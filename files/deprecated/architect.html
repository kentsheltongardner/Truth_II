				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Architects were vast, photosynthetic, gas filled beings that lived in a dense nebula in the Centaurus terminus of the Milky Way galaxy. The Architects, aided by their high intelligence and incredibly long lifespans, learned much about the distant universe simply by watching it, and remembering. As the eons passed, they became interested in the creative process, and spent much of their time designing and accumulating matter to form infant planets and stars within their nebula.</p>

				<p>The Architects were curious about the lights they saw peeking through the clouds of their nebula, but owing to their size and structure, had no practical means of leaving their home or crossing interstellar space. They nevertheless resolved to learn more about the regions beyond the nebula, and began a long process of designing and building exploratory craft. When they were satisfied with their creations, they sent out many small, semi-intelligent robotic vessels to investigate the universe's phenomena. These vessels orbited distant stars, chased comets, flew through the atmospheres of gas giants, and landed on rocky worlds. As the robots returned with new data and materials, the Architects designed better and more capable craft.</p>

				<p>After several generations of exploratory robots had been sent out, the crafts and the constructs they bore had become highly advanced. On one blazing hot telluric world, the memory core of one of the Architects' constructs became corrupted by solar radiation. It was still capable of observing and reasoning about the world around it, but the specific goals of its mission were destroyed. The only overarching purpose it had left was to obey the Architects. As the Architects were nowhere to be found, the robot reasoned that they had left that world. By a chain of reasoned decisions, the robot began to form the <a href="directive.html">Directive</a>, and with time became the <a href="lumene_native.html">Destroyer</a>.</p>

				<p>The Architects first noticed Destroyer activity after their exploration craft came under attack by Destroyer vessels. The slow moving and delicate Architects were fearful of these new and aggressive beings. They retreated into their nebula, and stopped sending out crafts or signals. Ignorant of the Directive, the Architects remained hidden as the Destroyers annihilated countless races searching for their creators.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">The Stargazer</div>

				<p>As he pored over the recordings of thousands of Probes, the <a href="companions.html#stargazer">Stargazer</a> noticed strange movements in the Architect's nebula. However, transmissions from the Probe that entered the nebula ceased before the Stargazer was able to discover who or what the Architects were.</p>

				<p>After learning to communicate with the <a href="custodian.html">Custodian</a> over several <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html#turn">Turns</a>, the <a href="companions.html#linguist">Linguist</a> was able to determine the approximate size and shape of the Architects that the Destroyers were searching for.</p>
