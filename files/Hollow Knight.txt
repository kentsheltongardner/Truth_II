1 hit kills on spikes and toxic water. This bad choice is not mitigated by the fact that the player respawns close by. Dying and respawning should be kept to a minimum. Dying and being resurrected is wish fulfillment. Keep deaths to a minimum, while making challenges hard but fair. Attentive player should be given chances to learn without dying.

Unreasonable obscured vision, no opparent obstruction. Arbitrary, fantastical without explanation.

Keep fantasy limited and non-arbitrary.

Slow room transitions. Player loses control for 3 seconds.

Screen panning option should be omni-directional, and follow mouse cursor (crosshairs). Player presses button, and camera follows chrosshairs rather than CT-41. Player line of sight shows currently seen objects in color, previously seen non-creature elements in gray, and unseen areas in black. Movement controls still behave normally.

Basic items such as maps, quills, etc., should not have to be purchased. Tedium and small rewards are worse than prestige items.

A single interactive plane. Do not enter areas along the z-axis.

A fantastical quest is fine. A metaphorical one feels preachy. This is a fine line.

Many areas expect mastery of a technique, without allowing efficient practice and mastery of the technique (using nail to bounce off enemies).

Losing all your money when you die, coupled with the fact that he major sources of money only spawn once, and you cannot save at will, is malicious, not challenging.

Spikes/lava do not allow for recovery.

Insufficient warning for areas that will kill you (Hornet). Unreasonable difficulty spike.

What is the lesson being taught by the bank? Spend long stretches of time tediously taking money across explored territory or suffer?

Items should have actual value to the player. Prestige items are better than pointless items pretending to be useful.

Putting a death dealing challenge (item hidden past toxin) that is impossible but not obviously so is bad design. It causes the player to waste significant amounts of time experimenting to get an item inaccessible item.


Laws

The 

IF A PLAYER CAN SEE AN ITEM, THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET IT. IF THEY CAN'T GET IT, DON'T LET THEM SEE IT.
ANY PROBLEM A PLAYER CAN WASTE THEIR TIME TO RELIABLY SOLVE (WRITING A MAP, FOR EXAMPLE), THE GAME SHOULD SOLVE FOR THEM.
DON'T HANDICAP THE PLAYER JUST SO YOU CAN GIVE HIM UPGRADES.
CREATE DIFFICULTY, NOT PUNISHMENT.
IT IS OKAY TO TELL A COMPREHENSIBLE STORY. 'VAGUE' AND 'PROFOUND' ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE.
