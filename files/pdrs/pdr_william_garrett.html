It's just an animal defending its territory. Still, I've declared the western caverns off-limits to all expedition members, and I had Cobb fill the entrance. Those caves are simply not a priority at the moment."</em></p>

Says 'Destroyers', same beings that wiped the planets in the Lumen system, are going to come for human colonies next. Says we need to hide deep in a place he calls the 'Sanctuary'. Apparently he and the Labor Society have been putting in overtime to build it. Explains some of the recents delays. My guess is something about being down there messed with his head.

I convinced Jessica to stow away in one of the stasis pods. Locked the deck with Captains's access only, destroyed my rank card. We'll keep them busy, there's still a chance we come out on top."</em></p>
