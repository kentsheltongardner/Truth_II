				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I was awakened out of metabolic stasis shortly after 06:00, and after a quick self-examination began thawing the command crew and research leads. None of us show any signs of hibernation rot, and we are recovering from metabolic stasis on schedule."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Cobb and several of the workers have complained to me about headaches and memory blackouts they experience while working in the mine. Two also reported hallucinations. I've examined all of those affected, and I can't find a physical cause. I've had technicians inspect the workers' environment suits, and everything checks out there too. I hesitate to say the causes are entirely psychological, but I can't rule the possibility out. Maybe long term complications of hibernation narcosis?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"It's been weeks now since I've seen any cases of cave sickness. It looks like the reduction in shift length must have worked, but it still bothers me that we have no idea what caused the episodes.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"The problem now is this increase in suicidal ideation. Almost one fourth of my patients over the last two weeks have reported vivid suicidal, uh, fantasies. What was it that Shen said... she called it a 'sudden urge to burrow deep into the warm ground and sleep forever'. She said it was a very positive thought, that it made her feel good. Sure, I can prescribe anti-psychotics, but I don't like handing out drugs when I have no idea what is causing the problem."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"That's now 3 missing persons in 2 and a half years. Montes and his attitude disappear in the mine, Ormeil goes missing on one of his nature walks, and now Kozlov... Garrett wouldn't confirm this, but one of Kozlov's assistants says that while experimenting on the device Kozlov just vanished, literally, into thin air. No warning, no remains, he was just gone.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Losing Kozlov hurts. It hurts me. I spent a lot of time with him during his treatments, and I felt like we were kindred spirits, as stupid as that sounds. But it also feels like there's a scary hole in the expedition's technical know-how with him gone. Sure, Garrett is the Commander, but Kozlov... He held things together, somehow, just by being here. His accidental aloofness was, paradoxically, very comforting. The remaining research staff can't make heads or tails of the device he was working on, and of course all his private notes are encrypted."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I just finished Sood's autopsy, but I'll keep him on ice for a while, just in case. He hanged himself. There's a rumor some crazed member of his congregation might have been responsible, but I find no evidence for that. I'm not going to indulge reactionary hysteria.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Sood never mentioned any emotional turmoil, and his psych evals were all in range. His suicide makes no sense, and I don't see what I could have done to stop it. His last PDR entry is bizarre. I knew there were going to be deaths. I didn't think they would be like this.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"One more thing. Last week one of the surveyors came to see me. Said he experienced a 'de-coupling' from his body while he was out in the rover. He claims his center of consciousness was aggressively dragged down and away from behind his eyes, and that for several minutes he was no longer himself. He says, and I quote, 'The planet is alive, and for a few moments I was the planet. It is happy we are here'. I don't know what to make of it."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I've had a few minutes to brood... Something is wrong. I think the colony is sick. A big chunk of the senior staff are gone, and it doesn't feel like an accident. The structure of our little society is fragile. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I sense a growing hostility, like... a predatory anticipation. The wolves are getting bolder. That sounds crazy, but I see it in some of my patients' eyes, and I don't know what to do about it. I'm scared."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"A group calling itself the 'Labor Society' just stormed the communications bunker and announced that they are taking control of the colony. I don't know what to do. This doesn't feel real."</em></p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">#DATE #TIME</div>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I'm currently holed up with a few others in the kitchen. The Laborers only have makeshift weapons, but there's a lot of them. It seems like every mine worker is a member of the group. Cobb has been preaching independence from 'Earth and her shackles' over the PA system. He still holds the comm bunker after almost 5 days. He says any marine that lays down his weapons and joins him will not face reprisal."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Cobb has taken the colony. They've herded us into the rec center, and Laborers are guarding the exits. Garrett and a few marines are barricaded inside the Argo, but they're fighting a losing battle."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Someone opened the Argo's cargo doors from the inside. Garrett and the marines are dead."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I haven't had a chance to record for a while. I've managed to slip away from the Laborers, and I'm burying my PDR here with the hope that it'll be found by future researchers. I don't know how much longer I will be able to trust my thoughts, now that I'm coming down with cave sickness. Whatever 'Presence' the Laborers keep prattling on about might be real.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Cobb is taking the colonists down to a place he calls the Sanctuary. Apparently he and the Labor Society have been working on it for some time. Cobb blew up the tunnel we came through to get here. He says anyone who resists will be killed. I think Cobb wants me. I don't know how much longer I will be myself.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I'm going back now. I'm not a collaborator. I am cooperating with the Labor Society only because I am a doctor, and I've taken an oath. The colonists will need me. Goodbye."</em></p>
