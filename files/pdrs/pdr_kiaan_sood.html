				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Ormeil's disappearance had a proximate cause. Recruit Montes, on the other hand... he asks me about this 'Labor Society', and three weeks later he's lost in a mining accident. Could be coincidence, but I have trouble believing in those...</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"The question was asked in confidence, and I told no one about it, not even the Captain. I could understand Montes getting lost, were he a careless or unintelligent worker, but the fact of his question, and my conversation with him, gave me the impression that he was neither.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"It's been 5 days since he last reported in, so if he is lost, his suit is out of power, his water has run out, and he is almost certainly dead. One can only hope his end was quick, and he didn't have to struggle with the question of activating his 'mercy system'. Requiescat in pace."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I've heard no more mention of a Labor Society, but I haven't personally made any inquiries. I'd prefer that my investigation remain discreet. My sources inform me there is some resentment among groups of mine workers regarding the terms of the expeditionary contract, which is admittedly draconian. I'll direct my investigation on the assumption that this 'Labor Society', if it exists, may be related to that discontent."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"My inspection of the warehouse, compared with our requisition logs, suggests that Administration materiel is being misappropriated by work crews, and that records are being falsified. I'll bring my concerns to Commander Garrett soon. First I'd like to have a better idea of where our inventory is being siphoned, and by whom."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I called in Cobb to the command meeting this morning. He denied that equipment and supplies are being misappropriated. Apparently last month one of the shafts collapsed, and buried a large amount of equipment and supplies which had to be replaced. Forunately no workers were present during the collapse. Cobb apologized, for himself and on behalf of several of his foremen, for being careless in his record keeping and adherence to policy. Apparently procedure for supply requisition was not being enforced. He assured the Commander there will be no more discrepancies going forward.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"He then offered to give the command crew a tour of the mine to verify that operations are proceeding strictly according to plan. Garrett said that wouldn't be necessary. Either Cobb's telling the truth, or he's one of the better liars I've ever met. I believed him while I was in the room, in spite of myself. You know, looking back, he managed to suggest my suspicions were misguided, and possibly paranoid, without ever saying so... while wearing a very contrite face... and while putting me and the Commander at ease... He's good."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Mine foremen are denying general access to lower portions of the mine, claiming stability hazards. It feels like a lie, but I can't prove intuition. I won't call a hearing without compelling evidence of conspiracy. My diligence in my priestly duties has not been what it should be."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"My operative, on my instructions, requested a transfer from the greenhouses to the mines. His request was promptly denied by Cobb. Cobb says that he doesn't want to worry about 'hand-holding' any more workers through cave sickness, but he's had no problem accepting transfers in the past. To me it seems that my operative has been found out, though he claims to have told no one about our correspondence. There is no way our communication could have been decrypted, or traced back to me. I don't understand."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Many workers are deliberately falsifying their work logs, and spend much more time in the underground than their records suggest. This can't be happening without Cobb's knowledge. Zhang's data indicates the possibility of movement from the base of the mine into the deeper underground, and I intend to reconnoiter the area over the next few days. Once I have proof that Cobb has been covering up theft, and is engaged in some kind of off-the-books activity, I'm gonna nail the bastard. Ad maiorem Dei gloriam, of course."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I was wrong. There's no conspiracy; nothing nefarious is happening in the mines. I'm just a paranoid fool. I needed for Cobb to be guilty, and was so eager to cast a stone. I am a Pharisee. My head has been hurting ever since I went down there. I can't... why..."</em></p>
