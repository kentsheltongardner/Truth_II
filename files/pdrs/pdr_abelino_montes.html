They're saying there was only one hibernation failure, which is actually pretty amazing considering how many of us there are. The shelters are up, but there's a lot of digging to do before we can start work on any perm facilities. We'll be cutting into the crater wall. Cobb says it'll be easier to regulate temperature and protect against radiation and weather there. Says he wants to reduce the number of variables to a minimum."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I've started getting cave sickness when I'm in the lower levels, like most of the other guys. Headaches, memory lapses, the whole thing. Doctor can't tell us what's causing it. I've told her, more than once, that I DO NOT EVER take my helmet off when I'm underground, but it doesn't seem like she believes me. Maybe it's normal for doctors to talk down to workers, but I can't say that I enjoy it. Could be she's just irritated she can't figure out what's wrong. Cobb says the pain went away for him after a few months."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Orozco's been trying to treat cave sickness by shortening the shifts in the mines, but it looks like Cobb was right. The symptoms were already receding before the new schedule.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"One more thing. This is just an observation, but the personnel choices feel... political. Garrett, Kozlov, Badawi, Arai, Zhang, Ines, Sood, myself... We are a living, breathing, inclusivity PSA. I just hope the Administration is as preoccupied with the expedition's success as it is with appearances.</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Then again, I suppose all the major players needed to be represented... An ET at the helm makes sense... Funding has to come from somewhere... I don't know... Pointless question, really. I'll just stick to digging holes."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Canosa from work group three says he wants to poach me, says he needs to replace one of his shift supervisors. He also told me I've been recommended for induction into the 'Labor Society'. I've never heard of it, and he asked me not to mention it to anyone else. Obviously I'm intrigued. I'll have to talk to Sood first, just to make sure membership is kosher. I'd rather not get into any trouble with the Administration by having conflicting obligations. I'll see if I can corner him after mass."</em></p>
