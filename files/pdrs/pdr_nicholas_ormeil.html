				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"This is Ensign Nick Ormeil speaking. Jessica just put that Caretaker of hers into sleep mode. She's seems sad, or angry, or some combination of the two. She suspects that there is more to the Jannah incidentthan meets the eye, and that the problem was caused by something other than the Caretaker's design. I'm no psychologist, but my guess is she is a little too attached to her work; that, or protective maternal instinct is kicking in. Hopefully she can get the problem fixed, whatever the cause. Nick out."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"This is Nick again. I've analyzed several samples of surface life. The biomolecular structures of Lumene and terrestrial life are completely distinct. Every life form I've dissected so far appears to be unicellular, if unicellular is the right word, with tissues growing around a branching neural web. At the center is a dense 'Seed', which I assume is an information storage medium. Very interesting. Nick out."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Nick here. I attempted to date several Lumene organisms... heh... I attempted to determine the lifespan of several Lumene organisms, and my estimates range from tens to hundreds of thousands of years. I speculate this correlates with the very long Lumene day."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Nick Ormeil reporting in. I don't yet understand what sustains the Lumene biosphere. The photosynthetic mechanisms of surface life are simply not sufficient to explain the quantity of life I'm seeing. What else is at the bottom of the food chain? My guess is there is some abundant autotrophic organism deep underground that sustains life in the caves. I'll have to get the go ahead to do real invasive research. I've seen enough sci-fi to be on my toes when I go underground. Nick out."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I talked to the Commander, and I've begun exploring the caverns on the west end of the crater, out past the fence. The life that's developed in the caverns is capable of incredible bioluminescence. Almost all organisms observed so far have various light emitting and light sensitive organs. Only a very few seem to be parasitic, using light emitted by other organisms to navigate. My flashlight causes some native life to scatter.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Also, I asked Orozco out. Her response was gentle, but firm, as expected. I'm sure she's had plenty of practice. Nick out."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, insofar as an alien world can look like an abstraction. Lumen 2 just gave me a present: I witnessed the birth of a litter(?) of tiny Lumene organisms. My guess is that this is a relatively rare event, at least by terrestrial standards. It appears that asexual reproduction is the norm here; at least I have seen nothing to suggest di- or polymorphism along sexual lines.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"My inital observations suggest that Lumene organisms evolve in a pseudo-Lamarckian fashion. Heresy, I know. That would mean dynamic genetic coding, which is a fascinating possibility. It certainly complicates the idea of speciation, if species in the normal sense is even a meaningful concept on Lumen 2."</em></p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">#DATE #TIME</div>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"My estimates of the possible size of Lumene organisms have been confirmed. The lower gravitational force, combined with the incredibly dense atmosphere, allow for organisms much larger than those seen on Earth. It seems my allometric simulations have some predictive validity after all. Suck it, Professor Miles! Nick out."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I have begun to track the hunting activities of what I believe to be an apex predator in this cave system. The beast, as I'm calling it, is an indiscriminate omnivore, routinely coming up from lower caverns in search of food. It is highly unlikely that the beast poses a threat to humans or sees us as potential prey, due to our very foreign appearance and behavior. It certainly can't digest or incorporate terrestrial proteins.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Seems more obvious than ever that there must be abundant autotrophic life deeper in the caverns. There's no other way to explain the amount of higher order life I'm seeing in the upper crust. Given the results of the geological scans and my talks with Zhang, my guess is that there is basal thermosynthetic life further down. That's next on the agenda. Nick out."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I am currently recording from chamber 17c, where the beast has cornered me. For almost 2 weeks it has behaved with caution or indifference, but for the last hour it has been corralling me. It is deviating wildly from its normal routine, and anticipating my movements in a way that is inconsistent with previous... Gotta go."</em></p>
