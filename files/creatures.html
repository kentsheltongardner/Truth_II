			<div class="page-title">Creatures</div>
			<a id="balloon"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Balloon</div>

				<p>The Balloon is a small floating animal that lives on or near the surface of Lumen 2. It intermittently inflates itself and expels air from one of many openings to create thrust for movement. Balloons do not deal damage to CT-41.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="barnacle"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Barnacle</div>

				<p>The Barnacle is a small, stationary shelled animal that grows on the wet surfaces of the Undergound. Though its shell is impervious to damage, it has a small vulnerablity near its orifice.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="blimp"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Blimp</div>

				<p>The Blimp is a floating creature held aloft by inflated air sacs, and is a cousin to the Balloon. It is most often seen on the surface of Lumen 2. The Blimp moves through the air by expelling gas from vectored biological nozzles. Beneath it dangle hundreds of tentacles, which deliver damaging electric shocks to any creature that it touches.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="blastfish"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Blastfish</div>

				<p>The Blastfish is an aquatic creature that slowly drifts through water by producing small pulses behind it. It is timid by nature, but will begin to pulse with light as a warning when other creatures draw near. If a creature encroaching on its territory does not flee, the Blastfish will expand explosively, producing a shockwave that damages enemies and pushes them away. After its violent exertion, the Blastfish slowly recovers and readies itself for another attack.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="bubbler"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Bubbler</div>

				<p>The Bubbler is a slow moving aquatic bottom feeder. It releases bubbles of corrosive gas that drift upward through water, dealing heavy damage to any creature that touches them. The bubbles burst when they reach the surface of water, releasing a noxious cloud that quickly dissipates. The Bubbler uses its bubbles to defend itself, or to kill prey, which then drifts down to be eaten. Bubblers come in several varieties, with armored and camoflaged variants. Different strains of Bubbler produce bubbles of different colors, that move more quickly and deal more damage.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="cleaner"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Cleaner</div>

				<p>Cleaners are small robots that move along the floors, walls and ceilings of Native ruins. They do not go out of their way to attack, but do deliver electric shocks that damage and stun any non-Native creatures they encounter.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="cryptfly"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Cryptfly</div>

				<p>The Cryptfly is a medium sized flying creature seen in the Catacombs and other areas where dead remains are found. It will attempt to maintain distance between itself and other creatures, while launching a corrosive venom at them.</p>

				<p>In addition to dealing damage to normal foes, the Cryptfly's venom is potent enough to eat through the resinous shells of creatures in Dormancy, allowing it to feast on the sleeper inside. CT-41 finds Cryptflies in the Stargazer's home, and learns that they are responsible for his death.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="drifter"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Drifter</div>

				<p>Drifters are small, feathery creatures carried about by currents of air. They are harmless, and pose no threat to CT-41. Though they are seen in many Lumene biomes, they are most abundant in Fesh'Togar's Domain.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="flail"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Flail</div>

				<p>The Flail is a small aquatic creature with two tails that it brings together rapidly to create thrust for forward motion. Flails flee whenever other creatures come close, and pose no threat to CT-41 or other creatures.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="flamethrower"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Flamethrower</div>

				<p>The Flamethrower is an aggressive medium sized beast found deep in the Lumene Underground. It has a craggy exterior, and ambulates atop dozens of cilia. The Flamethrower has a large pulsating dorsal sac full of liquid, which explodes violently when it is destroyed. When hunting, the Flamethrower launches bursts of the liquid from a spout-like forward appendage. The liquid bursts into flame upon contact with solids or liquids, and deals damage that persists for several seconds after contact.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="gamma-slug"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Gamma Slug</div>

				<p>The Gamma Slug is an unevenly knotted worm that slithers along floors, walls and ceilings. It is primarily found near the Fuel Dump. It begins to glow when it senses a threat, dealing heavy radiation damage to other creatures, based on their distance from the Gamma Slug. If it is killed while glowing, it will explode, leaving radioactive globules in the area of its death.</p>

			</div>

			<a id="harpoon-eel"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Harpoon Eel</div>

				<p>The Harpoon Eel is an ambush predator that lives in the depths of large bodies of water. It hides in crevices and holes that it bores, and waits for prey creatures to pass by. When prey or threats pass by a Harpoon Eel's home, there is a chance that it will launch out a barbed tentacle, dealing heavy damage on impact with the target, and pulling its victim back toward the opening. When a Harpoon Eel is killed, the crevice it inhabits may be explored.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="hoplite"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Hoplite</div> 

				<p>The Hoplite is a large, fleshy animal that protects itself with a versatile shell that it rotates toward threats. The Hoplite's shell is immune to damage, and CT-41 can only destroy a Hoplite by attacking its flesh.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="hopper"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Hopper</div>

				<p>The Hopper is a small animal with many jointed legs. It bounces away when it notices other creatures approaching, and does not deal damage to CT-41.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="nest"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Nest</div>

				<p>The Nest is a lumbering, shelled herbivore that houses a colony of swarming symbiotes on its back. When disturbed, a host of symbiotes will emerge from holes in the shell to ward off any irritant. These small flying creatures will hurl themselves recklessly and repeatedly at the target, dealing little damage individually. Collectively, however, the Nest's symbiotes can overpower all but the hardiest of foes.</p>

				<p>New symbiotes will sporadically emerge from the Nest, even while the others are fighting. Once the Nest is destroyed, the symbiotes will disperse, seeking new Nests to call home.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="pest-control"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Pest Control</div>

				<p>Pest Control are agile flying drones equipped with a weak laser designed to stun small animals. They are found throughout the Native Loci after CT-41 activates the Geothermal Power Station. Pest Control target and attack CT-41 and any invasive Lumene lifeforms, especially Vermin, wherever they are deployed. They do not attack Lumene Natives or Pets.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="puddle-trapper"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Puddle Trapper</div>

				<p>The Puddle Trapper is a sly predator that floats atop bodies of water, and from the top appears to be a stone. It has many grasping claws on its underside, and will move to prevent potential prey from escaping to the surface. If a Puddle Trap grabs a creature, it deals heavy damage as it attempts to ingest it. CT-41 can exploit a Puddle Trap's behavior to move it into an advantageous position. Hardier strains of the Puddle Trap appear in chambers containing boiling water or lava.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="puffball"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Puffball</div>

				<p>The Puffball is a round, plant-like creature that explodes if touched or shot. When it explodes, it releases a cloud of burrowing spores that deal light damage to nearby creatures. Puffballs of various strains can be found on the surface of Lumen 2 and all throughout the Underground. In addition to its spores, certain spiked variants of the Puffball blast shrapnel, while strains covered in pustules release acidic clouds. Puffballs can grow on floors, walls and ceilings.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="rockhide"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Rockhide</div>

				<p>The Rockhide is a fearless creature whose living component is almost entirely connective tissue. It is found all over Lumen 2 in areas with plentiful loose stone. It attaches itself to and builds an exoskeleton of rocks in order to move, camouflage itself, and take shelter from enemies and the elements. A Rockhide falls on or hurls itself at enemies to deal damage. In different regions of the Underground, Rockhides will use native stones as their exoskeletons, giving them properties such as increased strength, damage, or reflectivity. The Stone Giant is a highly Anomalous Rockhide.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="sapsucker"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Sapsucker</div>

				<p>The Sapsucker is a small and relatively harmless creature that lands on and cuts tiny holes into Deep Roots in order to drink Flow.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="sentinel"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Sentinel</div>

				<p>The Sentinel is a huge, double ended worm-like creature of arbitrary size that fills passageways. It has two heavily armored openings, one at either end, large enough for most Lumene creatures to pass through. Although Sentinels are impervious to attacks at their ends, they can be killed by sustained attacks to their midsections from outside. Attacks to a Sentinel from the inside result in the Sentinel flooding its body cavity with highly corrosive gas.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="silicate"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Silicates</div>

				<p>The Silicate is a hardy, crystalline lifeform that grows in the Crystal Kingdom, west of the Lower Ruins. Silicates deal damage to CT-41 on contact, and larger Silicates glow before firing lasers at foes. Silicates scatter damaging shards when destroyed. The Crystal King is a large anomalous Silicate.</p>

				<p>Silicates produce high crystalline tones and chirps as the communicate with each other. The Silicates' music grows louder and more complex where larger Silicate formations are present. The slow growing and speaking Silicates have a lifespan many times longer than that of other Lumene lifeforms.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="slime"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Slime</div>

				<p>Slime is a translucent, living mass of digestive enzymes, which deals damage to any creature it touches as it attempts to break it down chemically. Slime is incredibly unintelligent, and is usually stationary, but it will creep toward any movement it senses. Two Slimes of equal size can coalesce into a larger, more dangerous Slime.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="snarl"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Snarl</div>

				<p>Snarl is a predatory aquatic weed, whose wispy tendrils slow any creatures that attempt to pass through it. Though the Snarl prefers to consume small prey, over time it can deal significant damage to larger creatures.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="spikewheel"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Spikewheel</div>

				<p>The Spikewheel pushes itself along the floor of its caverns using tentacles that protrude radially from its spherical body. When it senses danger, it accelerates toward and jumps at its target. While in flight, it retracts its tentacles and exposes a ring of spikes that deal heavy damage on impact.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="torpedofish"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Torpedofish</div>

				<p>The Torpedofish is a jittery aquatic creature covered in small flagella-like appendages which it uses to move through water. When it perceives a threat or possible prey, it begins to inflate itself before moving toward the other creature. When it is ready to attack, it targets its victim with a biological laser, before rapidly deflating and launching a spear-like projectile from its forward appendage. After launching the spear, the Torpedofish spends a short period of time bringing a new one into firing position.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="uraninite_leech"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Uraninite Leech</div>

				<p>The Uraninite Leech are uranophiles, small, plant-like growth whose roots burrow into the Uraninite Vein. Though Uraninite Leeches do not attack CT-41, they will emit damaging radiation it attacked or touched. The Provider is a Uraninite Leech, forced to grow to enormous size by Uruthmu.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="vermin"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Vermin</div>

				<p>Vermin are flying creatures of varying sizes that latch onto sources of electricity and feed from them. They flock to industrial areas such as the Geothermal Power Station, the Factory, and the Recycling Plant. They are uninterested in most other Lumene lifeforms, but will attack CT-41 and drain its battery if given the chance. Native Pest Control drones are designed to cull Vermin population in sensitive areas.</p>

				<p>In order to restore power to the Underground, CT-41 must destroy several large Vermin, including the Vermin Supreme, to prevent them from draining energy from the Geothermal Power Station.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="watcher"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Watcher</div>

				<p>The Watcher is a small drone, created by the Outsider to observe goings-on in the Underground. It deals no damage, but does carry a flashlight, measuring lights, and an optical burst untended to temporarily blind creatures that draw too near. The Watcher is incredibly fast and nimble, and highly difficult to corner and destroy. Certain Watchers carry extra sensory equipment, which CT-41 can take if it destroys them.</p>

				<p>Once CT-41 has these sensors, its HUD will indicate anomalous readings.</p>

				<p>Possible Sensors</p>

				<p>Infrared Sensor</p>
				<p>Radiation Sensor</p>
				<p>Motion Sensor</p>
				<p>Energy Sensor</p>
