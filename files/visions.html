				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>As <a href="encyclopedia/ct_41.html">CT-41</a> explores <a href="encyclopedia/lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>, its <a href="encyclopedia/companion.html">Companions</a> occasionally directly communicate their experiences to it via Visions. Rather than speaking to CT-41, the Companions often show it events, overlaid onto the current scene, as they witnessed them. The visions generally have a ghostly, translucent aspect and ethereal sound, as the recollections of the Companions are not perfect in their details. Once a Vision is finished, its actors and props fade away.</p>

				<p>A Vision is only displayed and heard once. However, as CT-41 gains new Companions, it will receive new Visions in areas it has already explored.</p>
