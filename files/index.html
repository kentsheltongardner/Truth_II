Jessica administers a movement simulation to CT-41, before unlocking its motor controls. Jessica encourages CT-41 to talk to the Farsight Expedition's research leads aboard the Argo. CT-41 speaks with Ines Orozco, Nicholas Ormeil, and Vadim Kozlov. The research leads reveal important information about Lumen 2 and the Farsight Expedition to CT-41, and at Jessica's urging, the crew members give CT-41 brithday presents.</p>

With the Cadet's Rank Card, CT-41 is able to move to the Bulk Storage Deck and talk to Otis Cobb. Cobb equips CT-41 with its first weapon, the Thermal Laser. CT-41 exits the Argo via its eastern loading ramp, and kills or scatters all native Lumene lifeforms in the Crater's edge, including a swarm of scavengers in a small cavern in the Crater wall.</p>

It then moves up into the Beasthome, where it finds the Scattershot in one of the many Beast nests. CT-41 continues onward, and finally awakens the Beasts' god Dagon, whom they serve, and who has not entered Dormancy like the other Old Gods. CT-41 kills Dagon, and takes its Seed, which the Nanite Colony uses to produce the God's Hide.</p>

CT-41 moves down into the intense heat of the Underworld, and witnesses enormous Magma Worm adults as it is pulled west by the current.

CT-41 finds but cannot pass through a Security Door leading to the Restricted Area. After careful exploration, CT-41 takes control of the Golden Executor. CT-41 uses the Executor to pass the Security Door and enter the Restricted Area. CT-41 follows the Custodian through its highly modified home, blasting through Destroyer constructs that get in its way. CT-41 leaves the Executor to defeat the Custodian and take the Volatility Launcher. CT-41 moves back up out of the Restricted Area and takes the Mass Inhibitor from a previously inaccessible lab.</p>

					<p>36. <a href="chapters/chapter_36.html">As The Sand Of The Sea</a> - CT-41 returns to the Farsight Colony's Reactor, and uses the Tunneler to fall toward the Waste Dump. CT-41 uses the Mass Inhibitor to move past huge rocks that fall during the Destruction. CT-41 begins to move through the Broken Path, a treacherous series of dry and shattered caverns beneath the Sands that pass through the remains of the Spaceport. After navigating the crumbling stone and viscous ambush predators of the Path, CT-41 arrives at the Oasis.</p>

					<p>37. <a href="chapters/chapter_37.html">The Armies Of The Aliens</a> - CT-41 moves up to the Base Camp and finds an entrance cut into the Destroyer Wreck. CT-41 moves inside, and begins its claustrophobic ascent through twisted and mangled bulkheads of the Wreck's hull. CT-41 discovers and passes through many local Destroyer Gateways, eventually reaching a local Hub. CT-41 encounters various constructs as it moves from chamber to chamber. Eventually, using all of its tools to defeat powerful Manifestations and navigate the haphazard and alien environment, CT-41 reaches the top of the Wreck, and finds an active interstellar Gateway. The Torchbearer emerges, and CT-41 defeats the powerful Destroyer construct and takes its Coronal Aperture.</p>

Only periodic surface life and robotic beings remain. Equipped with the Lawgiver, CT-41 moves into the Razor Caverns, and maneuvers through near impossibly tight passages of sharp rock. With the Lawgiver equipped, CT-41 is able to destroy the unnatural barriers maintained by Voronash and his Angels, which prevent access to the Second Temple.</p>

					<p>39. <a href="chapters/chapter_39.html">His Angels Were Cast Out With Him</a> - CT-41 enters the Second Temple, and contends with the Angels that dwell there. Space, time and causality are not as they should be in the Second Temple. CT-41 passes through many chambers where it confronts increasingly powerful iterations of the living Outsider's transformation. Though these Angels are powerful, the Outsider does not permit them to be his equals. Before passing into the Laboratory, CT-41 defeats the Chayot ha Kodesh, the most powerful of the Outsider's children.</p>

CT-41 forces its way into the chamber of the Prime Altar, and confronts the Outsider, who is hurriedly attempting to modify the Altar for time travel. The Outsider's Seed blazes with light, as Voronash has entered his Seed to aid him in his work. CT-41 attacks the Outsider until Voronash emerges from the Seed to fight alongside his pupil. CT-41 attacks Voronash, but the Outsider heals him with Selves from his Seed. CT-41 attacks the Outsider, who is not healed by Voronash. When the Outsider dies, his Seed explodes, and all the Selves trapped within are absorbed by Voronash. The Devouring Spirit becomes more powerful than ever. CT-41 defeats Voronash, and captures his chaotic Self in the Necrolith, which becomes visibly unstable. CT-41 and the Outsider are trapped in the chamber of the Prime Altar, and use the Prime Altar to return to the moment of its activation.</p>

				<div class="index-chapter">

					<p>41. <a href="chapters/chapter_41.html">Repent Therefore</a> - CT-41 and the Outsider arrive on the Prime Altar at the instant the Outsider first activated it. The Necrolith enters the Outsider's mind, shows him visions of the future, and rebukes his evil. CT-41 can explore the chamber, and sees a vat filled with the remains of Native young. After coming to an unspoken accord, the Necrolith moves to the Prime Altar, and the Necromnacer sends it out of Creation. Shortly thereafter the Prime Altar begins to crackle with electrity, before being blown apart due to a massive electrostatic discharge. CT-41's carbon lattice brain is destroyed by the resulting electromagnetic pulse.</p>

CT-41 enters the recess at the base of the eastern Crater wall, where it finds a powerful version of itself and a Native, who identifies itself as the Outsider. The Native speaks to CT-41, and then presses a button on CT-41's opened interface panel. A download screen appears, as the Outsider begins to transfer data from the Caretaker's insulated sensory log to CT-41. CT-41 witnesses many of its exploits from its previous journey, as they actually happened. A download bar progresses along the bottom of the screen, as the credits are presented in a box to the side of CT-41's visual display.</p>
