Natives do not fear death in the same way that humans do, because they know that their progeny continues in a very literal way.
As such, Natives did not mind spending a very long time working on projects, even across generations.
Due to the length of their day and their long lifespans, Natives built their homes and workspaces to last, if possible indefinitely.
