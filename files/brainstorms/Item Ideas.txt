General

Lasers are optimized by Optimus
Human tools do not require adaptation
Certain items, particularly Native items and Kozlov's Toy, become more powerful the more particles CT-41 has accumulated
Destroyer items do not drain battery
God items are superior to all other items of their class

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Particles

Many items work better the more particles of a particular type CT-41 is carrying
Particles were treated as currency with intrinsic value by Natives, and are stored throughout the underground
				
Item					Beneficiary Particle		Particle Effect

Volt Gun 				Free electrons				Increases the bounce distance
Energy Siphon 			Superfluid					Increases the freeze rate
Strange Attractor		Magnetic monopoles			Increases the magnetic attraction
Impulse Cannon 			Stabilized neutronium		Increases the impulse strength and radius
Anti-Grav Beam 			Anti-gravitons				Reduces power drain

Mass Inhibitor			Higgs bosons				Inhibits a higher percentage of target mass

Each Fragment of Thosmodeme hides a weapon that will allow CT-41 to navigate through the Ruler's Locus.

Material Destruction

Item					Material Destroyed				Secondary Benefit

Sonic Auger				Dissipates loose dirt			Slightly slows movement
Impulse Cannon			Blows apart cracked stone		Produces radial impulse at point of impact
Resonator				Evaporates ferric metals		Deals more damage to targets the longer it is trained on them


Particle Tools

Tools

Item					Beneficiary Particle			Particle Benefits

Volt Gun 				Free Electrons					Increases the bounce count, stun duration, and damage
Energy Siphon 			Superfluid						Increases the energy extraction and slow rate
Strange Attractor		Magnetic Monopoles				Increases the magnetic attraction
Anti-Grav Beam 			Anti-Gravitons					Reduces power drain

Pure weapons

Ricochet Pulse			True Muonium					Increases initial damage, adds extra bounce
Ballista				Gravitons						Increases damage, reduces cool down period after fire
Scattershot				Pentaquarks						Increases damage per projectile, projectile count and spread
Feedback Chamber		Q-balls							Increases maximum charge and recoil (time to max charge constant)
Accelerator				Superconductors					Increases damage, fire rate and projectile speed
Medusa													Decreases minimum mass requirement

Toy						Unlike other Particle Tools, the Toy does not start out with any particles in its containment vessels	

						Stabilized Neutronium			Allows CT-41 to significantly slow the passage of time for a targeted object
						Strange Matter					Allows CT-41 to freeze an object in time, immutable
						Quantum Black Holes				Allows CT-41 to cause an object to travel unstoppably backward along its world line


Zero Energy/Aperture Tools

Unlike normal tools, these do not drain battery, and may admit significant amounts of matter

Solar Aperture			A slit opens wider over a period of seconds, exposing the corona of a white dwarf star
Spread Wave				

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Possible Weapons

Seeker Aperture			Admits a homing projectile into the universe

Nothing physically corresponded to a storage medium in the construct able to give us the information we received.

CT-41 initiates a process by which Destroyers enter the Underground
Bots power supply is constant, but low
With power restored, the unobstructed destroyer maintenance bot begins to retrofit the Underground
Destroyers contruct a gateway large enough to admit CT-41


Neutrino Collider		Neutrinos					Increases annihilation damage and radius


Particle Candidates

Good

Antimatter
Positronium
Gravitons
Tetraquark
Glueballs
Sterile neutrinos
Accelerons
Axions
Chameleon Particles

Bad

Tachyons

Ugly

Chaotic Matter

Seeds

Necrolith

Translates
Empowers other Seeds, both to join CT-41, and to cast their abilities

As more Fragments, Vessels and Angels are captured, Necrolith becomes more powerful
Necrolith only traps unnatural Self, and as such cannot open temporary Tears like the Outsider
Only natural Selves are drawn out of Creation to the Creator, and open Tears
Unnatural Selves must be cast out of the world by force


Laborer must be first awakened, and then unindoctrinated


Possible Abilities

Produce more light in darkened areas
Open Locus Doors

Signals weaknesses in an opponent
Suggests exploration options

Rapid healing and adaptation, no time compression required
Siphons Necrolith energy to CT-41 when its battery is low

Blinding light, temporarily disables sight

Fire a momentary laser blast at CT-41's current target
Produce a homing projectile that moves toward CT-41's current target

Knockback, blasts nearby enemies away
Radial blast that damages and knocks back enemies in a huge radius

Explorer - Communication, coordination and hints
Warrior - Offensive violence
Healer - Regeneration
Farmer - Defensive violence
Engineer - Traps and ethereal contraptions
Ruler - Coordination and hybrid abilities
Laborer - Construction, barriers, destruction
