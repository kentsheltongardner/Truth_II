				<a id="accelerator"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Accelerator</div>

				<p>The Accelerator was one of the crowning scientific achievements of the <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a>, constructed and improved over many <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html#turn">Turns</a> well into the <a href="age.html#stellar">Stellar</a> and <a href="age.html#hidden">Hidden Ages</a>. Huge amounts of energy from the <a href="geothermal_power_station.html">Geothermal Power Station</a> were used to accelerate and collide particles at incredible velocities, producing volumes of data about the sub-atomic world.</p>

				<p>In addition to performing scientific research, <a href="lineage.html#engineer">Engineers</a> working with the Accelerator also used it to build up stockpiles of exotic matter, which was stored in containment units near the Accelerator itself. Since these materials could be stored in small spaces and had high practical and scientific value, they were used as a reserve currency in Lumene finance.</p>

				<p>During his career working with the Engineers, the <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider</a> spent much of his time at the Accelerator, devising new theoretical models of the quantum universe, and designing improvements and new machinery to test his hypotheses.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> finds the <a href="../items.html#particle_emitter">Particle Emitter</a> at the eastern end of the Accelerator facility. CT-41 must be accompanied by the <a href="companions.html#stargazer">Stargazer</a> before it can pass through the Engineers' <a href="locus_door.html">Locus Doors</a> and enter the Accelerator.</p>

				<a id="condensation_vault"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Condensation Vault</div>

				<p>Condensation Vaults were high, narrow chambers where steam coming from the turbines in the <a href="Geothermal Power Station.html">Geothermal Power Station</a> was passively cooled, condensing into water that then flowed to the <a href="Reservoir.html">Reservoir</a>.</p>

				<a id="control_center"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Control Center</div>

				<p>The Control Center was a chamber above the heat of the <a href="Geothermal Power Station.html">Geothermal Power Station</a> where electrical output from the Power Station was monitored, and production was throttled to meet the demands placed on the power grid by <a href="Lumene Native.html">Native</a> facilities throughout the <a href="Underground.html">Underground</a>. The Control Center contained many displays, a <a href="Terminal.html">Terminal</a> giving access to the <a href="Connection.html">Connection</a>, and controls to manage the flow of water through the Power Station's tubing. Not far from the Control Center was a hidden chamber containing an <a href="Altar.html">Altar</a>.</p>

				<a id="domiciles"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Domiciles</div>

				<p>The Domiciles were a compact arrangement of Native living quarters in the Restricted Area. These dwellings were highly space efficient and modern, and were located very closed to the Engineers' working spaces.</p>

				<a id="power_distribution_room"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Power Distribution Room</div>

				<p>The Power Distribution Room was a compartment in the <a href="Geothermal Power Station.html">Geothermal Power Station</a> where voltage was manipulated and routed to various <a href="Lumene Native.html">Native</a> facilities throughout the <a href="Underground.html">Underground</a>.</p>

				<a id="prototyping_labs"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Prototyping Labs</div>

				<p>The Prototyping Labs were a collection of chambers in the Restricted Area where Native Engineers conducted scientific tests and fabricated experimental devices. The Golden Executor prototype was developed in the Prototyping Labs, along with a host of other robotic and cybernetic devices.</p>

				<a id="repository"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Repository</div>

				<p>The Repository was an area deep in the Restricted Area where <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> <a href="lineage.html#engineer">Engineers</a> and <a href="lineage.html#ruler">Rulers</a> stored and studied all <a href="destroyer.html">Destroyer</a> artifacts collected by the <a href="remnant.html">Remnant</a> after the <a href="destruction.html#sacrifice">Sacrifice</a>. Experts from other <a href="lineage.html">Lineages</a> were often invited to inspect the artifacts under the Rulers' supervision. The Repository contained several chambers where scientists conducted material and functional analysis.</p>

				<p>The most important piece of Destroyer wreckage studied in the Repository was the <a href="custodian.html">Custodian</a>, a damaged maintenance construct. Over several <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html#turn">Turns</a> of study, the <a href="companion.html#linguist">Linguist</a> learned to pry information out of the Custodian, and discovered much of the Destroyers' nature, history, and mission.</p>

				<a id="restricted_area"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Restricted Area</div>

				<p>The Restricted Area was a portion of the Hearth accessible only by Engineers, certain Rulers, and invited guests. It encompassed the Domiciles, the Prototyping Labs, the Molecular Assembler, and the Repository. Originally protected by the Engineers' Locus Doors, it was later sealed shut by Laborers during the Subjugation.</p>

				<a id="prototype_chamber"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Prototype Chamber</div>

				<p>The Prototype Chamber was a secure facility in the furthest reaches of the Basin, protected by an airlock and an Iron <a href="executor.html">Executor</a>. In the Prototype Chamber <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> <a href="lineage.html#engineer">Engineers</a> and <a href="lineage.html#ruler">Rulers</a> attempted to replicate <a href="destroyer.html">Destroyer</a> <a href="gateway.html">Gateway</a> technology. The Natives were successful in creating a working proof of concept, but the power requirement for their gateway was so high that use over meaningful distance was unthinkable.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> discovers the Prototype Chamber, and the #ITEM found within it. CT-41 can also use the prototype Gateway, a large tube shaped object that spans the chamber. Once the prototype is charged CT-41 can pass through the tube instantly, but is only able to move from one end of the chamber to the other. The Gateway consumes an enormous amount of energy, and its mass accumulator must charge for several years before CT-41 can use it. The Paralus' Tunnel Drive and the Tunneler are more efficient and convenient implementations of Tunneling technology.</p>
