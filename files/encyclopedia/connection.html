				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Connection was a system of light bearing cables that linked <a href="terminal.html">Terminals</a> throughout the <a href="realm.html">Realm</a>, allowing for rapid communication between individual <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a>, and between <a href="lineage.html">Lineages</a>. The Connection also allowed Natives at Terminals to access and confer with the <a href="intelligence.html">Intelligence</a>.</p>

				<p>During the <a href="age.html#hidden">Hidden Age</a>, the young <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider</a> used a hidden Terminal in the <a href="locus.html#badlands">Badlands</a> to communicate with other Natives of the <a href="remnant.html">Remnant</a>, and the <a href="lineage.html#engineer">Engineers</a> especially. It was via the Connection that he became educated in the physical sciences and mathematics, and began to impress the Engineers with novel theorems. Whe he revealed his Lineage to the Engineers over the Connection, they asked the <a href="lineage.html#ruler">Rulers</a> to grant him a special exemption to leave his <a href="locus.html">Locus</a>, and join the Engineers in the <a href="locus.html#hearth">Hearth</a>.</p>

				<p>Engineers designed and installed hardware for the Connection before the <a href="Destruction.html">Destruction</a>. They chose to lay physical communication lines due to the difficulty of wireless information transfer through the dense rock of the Undergound. After a Vermin infestation began to drain power produced at the <a href="hearth.html#geothermal_power_station">Geothermal Power Station</a>, the Connection and the Terminals ceased to function.</p>
				
				<div class="entry-section-title">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> may access the Connection once it has restored power to the Realm, and has found the <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider</a>. CT-41 can use the Connection to operate certain machinery, remotely or otherwise, and speak to the Intelligence.</p>
