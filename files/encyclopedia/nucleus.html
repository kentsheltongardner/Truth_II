				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Nucleus was a region centered between the Fortuna Crater and the Mantle, above and to the east of the Sea. It was isolated from the rest of the Underground by the Razor Caverns, a maze of rocks and Silicate lifeforms adapted to live near the Uraninite Vein. The Nucleus was the presumptive Locus of the Outsider, claimed by him after he fled from the Realm during the Hidden Age.</p>

				<p>After the disabling of the Paralus, the Nucleus became the dwelling of Angels, and Voronash. During its existence, the Nucleus was unknown to Thosmodeme, the Kindred, and the Farsight colonists.</p>

				<p>Central to the Nucleus was the Outsider's Laboratory, and the Prime Altar.</p>

				<a id="laboratory"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Laboratory</div>

				<p>The Laboratory was a research facility, built by the Outsider in the Nucleus, just east of the <a href="Uraninite Vein.html">Uraninite Vein</a>. Within his Laboratory he conducted his numerous experiments in the Hidden Age, and learned to build his <a href="Prime Altar.html">Prime Altar</a>.</p>

				<p>All facilities and equipment in the Laboratory were powered by a uranium fission reactor, which operated independently of the power grid built by Native Engineers. As such, the failure of the <a href="hearth.html#geothermal_power_station">Geothermal Power Station</a> did not cause a loss of power in the Laboratory.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Razor Caverns</div>

				<p>The Razor Caverns were a network of chambers east of and above the <a href="sea.html">Sea</a>, and integrated into the lower, eastern portion of the <a href="Uraninite Vein.html">Uraninite Vein</a>. They were filled with incredibly sharp rock formations, and slow growing <a href="silicate.html">Silicate</a> lifeforms. The caverns were marked by occasional waterfalls, pools, and slick, shear surfaces. These perilous caves were inhospitable to all but a feww of the hardiest <a href="Lumene.html">Lumene</a> lifeforms.</p>

				<p>During the events of Truth II, <a href="CT-41.html">CT-41</a> had to navigate the Razor Caverns before arriving at the <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider's</a> <a href="Laboratory.html">Laboratory</a>. As CT-41 moved deeper into the Caverns, Silicate formations grew larger and more dangerous, and the volume and complexity of their singing increased.</p>

				<p>In a far eastern and highly inaccessible chamber within the Razor Caverns, CT-41 encounters the <a href="crystal_king.html">Crystal King</a>, a <a href="../creatures.html#silicate">Silicate</a> formation grown so large that it has gained intelligence. The musical patterns in the King's chamber are incredibly complex. The Crystal King responds to any aggression from CT-41 with devastating laser attacks, and cannot be destroyed.</p>

				<p>If the CT-41 has the Linguist with it, it can speak to the Crystal King, and learn of its hatred of the Outsider. Once CT-41 has explained its situation, the Crystal King will gift it the Photon Trap, a crystal capable of storing a huge amount of energy. With the Photon Trap CT-41 will glow from the seams between its armor panels.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Second Temple</div>

				<p>The Second Temple, or the Temple of Truth, stood in opposition to the <a href="temple.html">Temple</a> of <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a>. It was built by <a href="lineage.html#exalted_children">Exalted Children</a>, the Lineage of the Outsider, and was the most dazzlingly sophisticated facility ever produced by Lumene Natives. The walls and machinery of the Second Temple were constructed of materials unknown to human scientists and Native Engineers alike. Within many of the Temple's chambers, the ordinary laws of physics were suspended.</p>

				<p>In the Second Temple, the Angels worked for Voronash, seeking to break apart matter at its most fundamental level, annihilate space, and otherwise undermine the purpose of the Creator. They did so to restore the truths of the Real to Creation.</p>

				<a id="uraninite_vein"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Uraninite Vein</div>

				<p>The Uraninite Vein was an enormous desposit of uraninite and coffinite ores in the crust of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>, beneath the <a href="fortuna_crater.html">Fortuna Crater</a>. This rich lode of ore was mined and processed by <a href="farsight_expedition.html">Farsight</a> colonists and the <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider</a> for use as fuel, and its ambient radiation was absorbed by <a href="../creatures.html#uraninite_leech">Uraninite Leeches</a> and the <a href="provider.html">Provider</a>. The Outsider was the first rational claimant to the Uraninite Vein, and considered it to be part of his reclusive Locus.</p>

				<p>During the <a href="age.html#hidden">Hidden Age</a>, the <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider</a> constructed his <a href="#laboratory">Laboratory</a> on the eastern edge of the Uraninite Vein. As he hid in his Laboratory during the <a href="age.html#dark">Dark Age</a>, <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a> was unable to influence him, due to the incredibly dense and mildly radioactive ores in the Vein.</p>

				<p>The <a href="farsight_colony.html">Farsight Colony</a> was also hidden from Thosmodeme by the Vein, as well as by distance. Only when excavation for the <a href="mine.html">Mine</a> started on the western side of the Vein did Thosmodeme begin to exert influence over colonists, and mine workers began to come down with <a href="cave_sickness.html">Cave Sickness</a>.</p>

				<p>Shortly after Thosmodeme summoned <a href="otis_cobb.html">Otis Cobb</a> to his <a href="holy_city.html#throneroom">Throneroom</a>, <a href="fragment.html#uruthmu">Uruthmu</a> began accelerating the mutation of a Uraninite Leech near the <a href="sanctuary.html">Sanctuary</a>, encouraging it to grow to immense size. This unnatural creature, called the 'Provider' by human <a href="child.html">Children</a> of Thosmodeme, would later provide electrical power to the Sanctuary.</p>
