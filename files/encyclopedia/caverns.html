				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Caverns were a network of naturally formed subterranean chambers and tunnels, accessible from the surface of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a> via a fissure at the western edge of the <a href="fortuna_crater.html">Fortuna Crater</a>. They housed a typical Lumene <a href="shallows.html">Shallows</a> ecosystem, which depended a great deal on the rains and the <a href="migration.html">Migration</a> that followed the dusk and dawn seasons of the <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html#Turn">Turn</a>. In the deepest and easternmost chambers of the Caverns some <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> architecture was present, but it was heavily damaged by the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a>, exposed to the elements, and overrun by primitive life.</p>

				<p>The Caverns were the hunting grounds of a solitary <a href="beast.html">Beast</a> which killed Ensign <a href="nicholas_ormeil.html">Nicholas Ormeil</a> on #DATE, in a highly uncharacteristic attack. Ormeil left behind a <a href="items.html#flashlight">Flashlight</a> and recording and transmission equipment in the upper portions of the Caverns.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> enters the Caverns, recovers the Flashlight, and kills the Beast. In the <a href="beasts_den.html">Beast's Den</a> CT-41 finds Ormeil's headless skeleton, his <a href="personal_data_recorder.html">PDR</a>, and his Ensign's <a href="rank_card.html">Rank Card</a>.</p>
