				<p>The Oracle was a quantum computer superintelligence that helped to guide the <a href="interstellar_defense_fleet.html">Interstellar Defense Fleet</a> during the <a href="war_of_extinction.html">War of Extinction</a>. Larger IDF fleet vessels such as the <a href="paralus.html">Paralus</a> were able to carry a local instance of the Oracle, which required a large <a href="stabilization_chamber.html">Stabilization Chamber</a> to remain coherent. Crew members were able to interact with the Oracle via their <a href="neural_augment.html">Neural Augments</a> and the <a href="network.html">Network</a>. The Oracle proved essential in prolonging the war against the <a href="destroyers.html">Destroyers</a>, but all known instances of the Oracle were eventually destroyed.</p>

				<p>The primary responsibilities of the Oracle, and those that set it apart from other computer systems, were optimization and prediction. The Oracle excelled at peering into likely futures, and producing ideal solutions to complex problems. Near the end of the War of Extinction, the Oracle saw no realistic solution to Destroyer agression, and predicted a dark fate for humanity.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> was able to speak to the Paralus' Oracle after <a href="voronash.html">Voronash</a> left the ship.</p>
