				<p>The Destruction was the methodical annihilation, by the <a href="destroyer.html">Destroyers</a>, of all <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> life and structure on the surfaces of <a href="lumen_3.html">Lumen 3</a>, <a href="lumen_4.html">Lumen 4</a>, <a href="nox.html">Nox</a>, and <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Background</div>

				<p>Near the end of the <a href="age.html#stellar">Stellar Age</a>, and against the <a href="lineage.html#ruler">Rulers</a>' stern objections, Native <a href="lineage.html#explorer">Explorers</a> launched thousands of interstellar <a href="probe.html">Probes</a> toward their neighboring star systems. Many of these Probes eventually arrived at their destinations, and began transmitting valuable data back to the receiving stations in orbit around Lumen 2.</p>

				<p>One of these Probes was detected by a Destroyer sensor station. The Destroyers extrapolated the Probe's system of origin, and three dormant <a href="gateway.html">Gateway</a> capital ships converged in interstellar space before moving toward <a href="lumen.html">Lumen</a>. When the Gateways arrived at the outskirts of the system, they activated, and spacecraft from the Orion <a href="stellar_harvester.html">Stellar Harvester</a> began to pour through. The Natives soon detected the Gateways, and sent envoys aboard several interplanetary vehicles to establish first contact. However, their attempts at communication were ignored, and the vessels were destroyed.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Destruction</div>

				<p>One Gateway moved toward each of Lumen's populated planets, and Lumen 3 was the first to be attacked. Smaller Destroyer escort vessels attacked orbital stations, mining vessels and transport craft, clearing the space around the planet so the Gateway could move in. Positioning itself above the planet, the Gateway opened a window to the Orion Stellar Harvestor, and blasted colonized portions of the surface of Lumen 3 with the full fury of a star. The Gateway moved across the surface in a gridlike pattern, leaving tell-tale markings. Surface installations were atomized, and radiation penetrated deep into the crust, killing the many Natives who had crowded into shallow subterranean shelters.</p>

				<p>Natives on Lumen 2 and Lumen 4 saw the scouring of Lumen 3, and the Rulers on both worlds devised plans of last resort. Thousands of Natives on Lumen 4 crowded onto spacefaring vessels on the surface and in orbit, and fled the impending attack. The smaller Destroyer vessels pursued them, until all the escaping vehicles were eradicated. The second Gateway reached Lumen 4, and delivered the same type of solar bombardment that razed the surface of Lumen 3.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Sacrifice</div>

				<p>After witnessing the annihilation of their ships and colonies on <a href="lumen_3.html">Lumen 3</a> and <a href="lumen_4.html">Lumen 4</a>, the <a href="lineage.html#ruler">Rulers</a> on <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a> announced a retreat into the ancestral <a href="womb.html">Womb</a>. They believed, correctly, that the crust of Lumen 2 would protect the <a href="kindred.html">Kindred</a> against the solar weaponry of the <a href="destroyer.html">Destroyer</a> capital ships that had scoured the surfaces of the two colony worlds. However, there was little time to evacuate with a Destroyer <a href="gateway.html">Gateway</a> bearing down on the planet.</p>

				<p>The <a href="lineage.html#warrior">Warriors</a>, who had long languished in peaceful <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> society, unanimously decided to reject the call to the Womb, and piloted any and all spacecraft they could find against the oncoming Gateway. Hiding in the sensor shadow of <a href="nox.html">Nox</a>, the Warriors waited for the enormous vessel to draw close to Lumen 2. As the Gateway took position over the <a href="fortuna_crater.html">Fortuna Crater</a>, the Warriors accelerated from behind the moon, breaking cover and ramming into the behemoth vessel and its escorts at maximum speed. In a battle which lasted only a few minutes, the Gateway and all its escort craft were destroyed by the unexpected attack.</p>

				<p>While the other Gateways in the <a href="lumen.html">Lumen</a> system moved toward Lumen 2, thousands of Natives were able to gather to the Womb from across its surface, and hide deep beneath the Fortuna Crater. Before the second and third Gateways arrived, many daring Lumene Natives remained on and even returned to the surface to collect smoking Destroyer wreckage, and carry it deep into the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>.</p>

				<p>The remaining Warriors were low on fuel, but even more critically, they had expended the element of surprise. The Destroyers approached Lumen 2 more cautiously in their next attack, with escort craft positioned well ahead of the Gateways. The Warriors fought as well as their technology and training allowed, but one by one their spacecraft were destroyed. The Gateways then moved in, and bombarded the inhabited surfaces of Lumen 2 and Nox, wiping both worlds clean of all Native life and structure.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Aftermath</div>

				<p>Most Natives who had gathered in the <a href="womb.html">Womb</a> survived, protected from the radiation and heat by the depth of their caves and the incredibly dense <a href="uraninite_vein.html">Uraninite Vein</a>. Once the seemingly interminable roar and shaking of the Destruction ended, Natives began to search out their wounded <a href="kindred.html">Kinsmen</a>, and brought them to the <a href="refuge.html">Refuge</a> for medical treatment. <a href="lineage.html#engineer">Engineers</a> worked feverishly to restore water and power, while <a href="lineage.html#farmer">Farmers</a> distributed what food they could gather. <a href="lineage.html#ruler">Rulers</a> coordinated immediate relief efforts, while the <a href="lineage.html#explorer">Explorers</a> did what they could to help the other <a href="lineage.html">Lineages</a>.</p>

				<p>During the Destruction, a <a href="proto_native.html">Proto-Native</a> organism living in the Womb was awakened from <a href="dormancy.html">Dormancy</a>. This creature was later found by Farmers, and brought to the <a href="farmland.html">Farmland</a>. Its descendants were the <a href="lineage.html#laborer">Laborers</a>, the seventh Lineage of the Kindred.</p>

				<p>All of the <a href="destroyer.html">Destroyer</a> wreckage gathered from the surface was confiscated by the Rulers, and taken to the <a href="basin.html">Basin</a>. The debris and artifacts were later housed and studied in the <a href="basin.html#repository">Repository</a>.</p>

				<p>No <a href="lineage.html#warrior">Warriors</a> were found among the assembled survivors, and they were presumed extinct. During the latter half of the <a href="age.html#hidden">Hidden Age</a>, as discontent rose among the Lineages, the Rulers worked with <a href="lineage.html#healer">Healers</a> and Engineers to create <a href="executor.html">Executors</a>. Each of these machines housed a Warrior's <a href="seed.html">Seed</a>, and took up the Warrior's role of defending the <a href="realm.html">Realm</a> and enforcing the Rulers' mandates.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Punishment</div>

				<p>As soon as all emergency needs had been attended to, the <a href="lineage.html#ruler">Rulers</a> convened an emergency <a href="great_council.html">Great Council</a>. During the Council the survivors of the Destruction, or '<a href="remnant.html">Remnant</a>', debated the <a href="kindred.html">Kindred</a>'s path forward. All <a href="lineage.html">Lineages</a> unanimously agreed that it was unwise to return to the <a href="emptiness.html">Emptiness</a>, lest the Remnant be discovered. Popular sentiment favored the absent <a href="lineage.html#warrior">Warriors</a>, and rose against the present <a href="lineage.html#explorer">Explorers</a>. The Rulers <a href="sanctification.html">Sanctified</a> the Warriors' <a href="locus.html">Locus</a> in the <a href="frontier.html">Frontier</a>, and decreed that no other Lineage should take up abode there.</p>

				<p>The Explorers, on the other hand, were seen by most members of the other Lineages as indirectly responsible for the Destruction. The <a href="lineage.html#engineer">Engineers</a> that had helped the Explorers to design their <a href="probe.html">Probes</a> were chastised, but the entire Lineage of the Explorer was punished harshly. They would be confined to the <a href="badlands.html">Badlands</a>, to build and operate waste management machinery for the now hidden Remnant. The Rulers passed strict reproductive laws, making it almost impossible for Explorers to gain the <a href="right_of_continuation.html">Right of Continuation</a>.</p>

				<p>Thus, while other Lineages returned to, rebuilt and beautified what they could of their ancestral homes, the Explorers were banished to the dry and barren Badlands, to build and operate soulless machinery as their numbers dwindled. Though the Rulers never physically harmed a single Explorer for their role in bringing the Destruction to <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>, they did practically condemn them to extinction.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> sees ample evidence of the Destruction in the <a href="desolation.html">Desolation</a> and other regions in the <a href="division.html#shallows">Shallows</a>. It also finds several <a href="destroyer.html">Destroyer</a> items and constructs in the <a href="basin.html#repository">Repository</a>, the <a href="farsight_colony.html#vault">Vault</a>, and the <a href="sands.html">Sands</a>.</p>
