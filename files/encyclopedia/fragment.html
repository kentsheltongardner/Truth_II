				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>A Fragment of <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a> was a portion of himself, deliberately sundered from him to serve his purposes. Each of his Fragments was a potent <a href="singularity.html">Singularity</a>, possessing great power over <a href="self.html">Selves</a> in its vicinity.</p>

				<p>During his reign as Lord of Lumen, Thosmodeme produced two types of Fragments. A <a href="#greater_fragment">Greater Fragment</a> was a Fragment powerful enough to take on a physical form of its own using surrounding materials. A <a href="#lesser_fragment">Lesser Fragment</a>, though still formidable, needed to be housed within a living creature, called a <a href="vessel.html">Vessel</a>.</p>

				<p>Thosmodeme feared that if his Fragments were separated from him for too long, their wills might begin to diverge from his. As such, they were constantly monitored and dominated by him, and were not permitted to create Fragments of their own. All Fragments returned periodically to the <a href="temple.html#throneroom">Throneroom</a>, to have their wills realigned with Thosmodeme's.</p>

				<p>Due to his use of Fragments and his resulting diminishment, Thosmodeme was less powerful than <a href="voronash.html">Voronash</a> during the battle in the Throneroom.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Greater Fragment</div>

				<p>Greater Fragments were <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme's</a> most capable and fearsome creations. They were large portions of his will, sundered from him to carry his purposes abroad. Although the Greater Fragments could assume physical form, it took them significant effort to maintain, and as such they spent much of their lives in an ethereal existence.</p>

				<p>Thosmodeme only produced three Greater Fragments during his reign. These were <a href="#fesh_togar">Fesh'togar</a>, the Spirit of Air, <a href="#uruthmu">Uruthmu</a>, the Spirit of Water, and <a href="#azeselon">Azeselon</a>, the Spirit of Fire. Human <a href="child.html">Children</a> under Thosmodeme's sway in the <a href="sanctuary.html">Sanctuary</a> referred to these Fragments as Fesh'togar-Thosmodeme, Uruthmu-Thosmodeme, and Azeselon-Thosmodeme, reflecting their oneness with their maker.</p>

				<p>The three Greater Fragments were birthed in response to the <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> <a href="uprising.html">Uprising</a>, as Natives protected by the <a href="secret_thought.html">Secret Thought</a> pushed into the <a href="temple.html">Temple</a>. The Greater Fragments were Thosmodeme's destroying angels, tasked with the annihilation of the rebels. Together with hordes of <a href="servant.html">Servants</a> the Greater Fragments pushed the Natives back.</p>

				<p>After the Native rebellion was routed and dispersed in the <a href="assembly_hall.html">Assembly Hall</a>, Fesh-Togar was sent to the <a href="shallows.html">Shallows</a>, Uruthmu to the <a href="womb.html">Womb</a>, and Azeselon to the <a href="deep.html">Deep</a>. Obedient to Thosmodeme, they killed and consumed most Natives they encountered, sparing only the <a href="companions.html#deliverer">Deliverer</a> and a few others, and taking them prisoner.</p>

				<p>When the <a href="slaughter.html">Slaughter</a> was complete, Thosmodeme filled the Three with new purpose. Fesh-Togar would interrogate the Deliverer, attempting to break his will and discover a way to thwart his Secret Thought. Uruthmu would capture and uplift the lower creatures of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>, raising them to be worthy Servants to Thosmodeme. Azeselon would attempt to <a href="synchronization.html">Synchronize</a> with the <a href="magma_worm.html">Magma Worms</a>, whose young dwelt in the <a href="magma_chamber.html">Magma Chambers</a>. During the course of their missions, the Three returned to the <a href="throneroom.html">Throneroom</a> several times every <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html#turn">Turn</a>, to make a complete report of their activities, and to have their wills realigned with their Thosmodeme's.</p>

				<p>Like Thosmodeme, each Fragment possessed a <a href="domain.html">Domain</a>, the area in which they were able to project their will. Within that Domain was a <a href="sanctum.html">Sanctum</a>, an area Children and Servants were forbidden to enter unless explicitly bidden. Within their Domains were living doors, called <a href="../creatures.html#sentinel">Sentinels</a>, which only opened when they sensed the presence of their master.</p>

				<a id="fesh_togar"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Fesh'togar</div>

				<p>Fesh'togar, or the Spirit of Air, was a <a href="#greater_fragment">Greater Fragment</a> of <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a>, originally created along with his brothers to quell the <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> <a href="uprising.html">Uprising</a>. After the Uprising was crushed and the rebelling Natives were exterminated or captured, Thosmodeme sent Fesh'togar to the <a href="lineage.html#healer">Healers'</a> <a href="locus.html">Locus</a>. There he was tasked with breaking the mind and will of Native captives, including the <a href="companions.html#deliverer">Deliverer</a>. Fesh'togar ultimately hoped to force the captured Natives to reproduce once their minds were his.</p>

				<p>Though Fesh'toger failed to defeat the <a href="secret_thought.html">Secret Thought</a>, he did discover ways to animate the bodies of the dead. After destroying a Native <a href="seed.html">Seed</a> he could still control its limbs and vital functions, producing beings such as the <a href="puppet.html">Puppet</a> from Native corpses. He tried, and failed, to produce new Natives from Seeds and tissues kept in medical storage. Fesh'togar's assumed form was ghastly and ethereal, reflecting his association with the dead, and reminiscent of the howling, unpredictable winds in his <a href="sanctum.html">Sanctum</a>.</p>

				<a id="uruthmu"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Uruthmu</div>

				<p>Uruthmu, or the Spirit of Water, was a <a href="#greater_fragment">Greater Fragment</a> of <a href="Thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a>, originally created with his two brothers to destroy the rebelling <a href="lumene_native.html">Natives</a> during the <a href="uprising.html">Uprising</a>. After the Natives were killed or captured, Uruthmu was sent to the <a href="womb.html">Womb</a>. In its primordial pools, where the Lumene Natives and many other lifeforms first evolved, Uruthmu bred Thosmodeme's <a href="servant.html">Servants</a>. Each existed for a specific purpose, whether that was relaying Thosmodeme's thought, tunneling, destroying threats, or serving as high calorie food. Uruthmu endeavored to raise beings to rationality, but due to his overriding control, his subjects never had sufficient autonomy to develop reason.</p>

				<p>After settling into the Womb, Uruthmu took on a form that allowed him to manipulate and move quickly through the waters of his <a href="domain.html">Domain</a>.</p>

				<a id="azeselon"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Azeselon</div>

				<p>Azeselon, or the Spirit of Fire, was a <a href="#greater_fragment">Greater Fragment</a> of <a href="Thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a>, originally created along with his brothers to quash the <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> <a href="uprising.html">Uprising</a>. After the <a href="slaughter.html">Slaughter</a>, Azeselon was sent by Thosmodeme to the caverns nearest the <a href="magma_chamber.html">Magma Chambers</a>. There he discovered new <a href="servant.html">Servants</a> to obey Thosmodme, and attempted to communicate with the <a href="magma_worm.html">Magma Worm</a> young.</p>

				<p>Azeselon's <a href="domain.html">Domain</a> covered portions of the Magma Chambers and the <a href="lineage.html#engineer">Engineers'</a> <a href="locus.html">Locus</a>. In his fiery abode Azeselon took on his lasting form, one that allowed him to exist in evironments of extreme heat. He was a being of strange armor and fire.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Lesser Fragments and Vessels</div>

				<p>Lesser Fragments were <a href="fragment.html">Fragments</a> of <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a> too weak to create their own form. Instead they took residence in the bodies of living creatures, called 'Vessels'. <a href="otis_cobb.html">Otis Cobb</a> became a Vessel to a Lesser Fragment when Thosmodeme brought him to the <a href="throneroom.html">Throneroom</a>. When the Vessels that bore Lesser Fragments grew old or feeble, or when Thosmodeme decided their purpose was fulfilled, he called them back to himself to be resorbed.</p>

				<p>As part of his own <a href="purification.html">Purification</a>, Thosmodeme would occasionally cast out portions of himself that he considered chaotic or destabilizing. These Lesser Fragments would be vomited forth into expendable <a href="servant.html">Servants</a>, called 'Vessels of Filth'. These unpredictable Vessels were then taken by <a href="../creatures.html#temple_guard">Temple Guards</a> to the <a href="pit.html">Pit</a>, to be consumed by <a href="voronash.html">Voronash</a>. Voronash became increasingly volatile as he was fed Vessels of Filth for an <a href="age.html">Age</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> encounters and defeats the <a href="#greater_fragment">Greater Fragments</a> of <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a>, and captures them in the <a href="necrolith.html">Necrolith</a>. Each Greater Fragment that CT-41 captures allows it to pass by its corresponding <a href="../creatures.html#sentinel">Sentinels</a>. CT-41 also defeats and captures several <a href="#lesser_fragment">Lesser Fragments</a> in the <a href="temple.html">Temple</a>, including the <a href="../creatures.html#temple_guard">Temple Guards</a>. Capturing any of these Fragments greatly increases the power available to the <a href="commentary.html">Commentary</a> and the <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> <a href="seed.html">Seeds</a> that accompany CT-41.</p>
