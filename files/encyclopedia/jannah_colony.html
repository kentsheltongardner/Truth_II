				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>Jannah was the name given to the first extra-solar planet colonized by humans. Jannah was a watery, Earth-like world, though slightly more massive. It had a similar atmospheric composition, orbited a medium sized orange star, and had a molten core and magnetosphere. In spite of the many favorable factors suggesting the possibility of extraterrestrial life, the colonists on Jannah never found evidence of native life or intelligence there.</p>

				<p>In <a href="universal_standard_time.html">#YEAR</a>, a consortium of Saudi businessmen applied for and received the first ever extra-solar colonial license from the <a href="united_colonial_dministration.html">Colonial Administration</a>. The group then bankrolled the construction of an enormous antimatter rocket, the <a href="ramah_al_amal.html">Ramah al'amal</a>, and a colonial lander. The Ramah arrived at Jannah in #YEAR UST, and the lander touched down without incident. The colonists constructed shelters on the surface, and began to cultivate crops.</p>

				<p>In #YEAR UST, the Jannah colony was shaken by the <a href="#massacre">Jannah Massacre</a>, in which one of its <a href="caretaker.html">Caretaker</a> Colonial Assistants killed two civilians and several <a href="marine.html">Marines</a>.</p>

				<p>In #YEAR UST, after the collapse of the <a href="interstellar_defense_fleet.html">IDF</a>, Jannah's then heavily populated surface was razed from orbit by <a href="destroyer.html">Destroyer</a> <a href="gateway.html">Gateways</a>. None of Jannah's human inhabitants survived.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Massacre</div>

				<p>In #YEAR <a href="universal_standard_time.html">UST</a>, one of the Jannah Colony's <a href="caretaker.html">Caretaker</a> Colonial Assistants went berserk, destroying a habitation, and killing five colonists. The massacre was reported to the <a href="united_colonial_administration.html">Colonial Administration</a>, whose investigation determined the cause of the massacre to be an improper interfacing of the Caretaker's <a href="behavioral_control_unit.html">Behavioral Control Unit</a> by <a href="yamato_robotics.html">Yamato Robotics</a>. The Administration sent word to all colonial expeditions to deactivate and disassemble their Caretakers.</p>

				<p>In actuality, the massacre was a deliberate attack, orchestrated by a human, using the Caretaker as a weapon. Ester Lucas, a young but accomplished botanist, arrived on Jannah with her then fiance, Cal Sobeck, secretly hoping to be the first couple married outside the Solar system. However, after several months on Jannah Cal called of the engagement, and was indifferent to Ester's attempts to rekindle their romance. Eventually Cal married another woman, and Ester married another man.</p>

				<p>Though she appeared content to those around her, Ester's resentment against Cal grew with time, becoming an unexpressed hatred. Though on apparently friendly terms with Cal and his wife, Ester needed him to know her anger. After the birth of her first child she formulated a plan.</p>

				<p>In the colony's greenhouse Ester worked extensively with one of Jannah's Caretakers. During her thousands of interactions with it she happened upon a convoluted logical exploit in the <a href="shenzen_protocol.html">Shenzen Protocol</a>. The exploit allowed her to use the Caretaker's Behavioral Control Unit to produce arbitrary behavior, according to her instructions. One night, after tucking in her son, and before going to bed with her husband, she gave the Caretaker several orders that were the direct cause of the massacre.</p>

				<p>That night the Caretaker broke into to Cal's habitation and delivered a message to him from Ester. It then killed his wife as she lay terrified in bed, and then killed Cal, before demolishing their home. Jannah's <a href="marine.html">Marine</a> garrison responded quickly to the attack. The Marines, who were not equipped or trained to fight Caretakers, suffred heavy caualties. Three Marines were killed and several others injured during the night's battle.</p>

				<p>In spite of their losses the Marines succeeded in damaging and finally incapacitating the Caretaker. No record of Ester's manipulation could be retrieved from its long term storage, and though Ester was questioned about the Caretaker's behavior, she was never suspected on Jannah for her involvement in the massacre.</p>
