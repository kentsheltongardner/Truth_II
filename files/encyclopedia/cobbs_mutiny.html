			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>Cobb's Mutiny was a violent insurrection lasting two days, starting on #DATE <a href="universal_standard_time.html">UST</a>, in which <a href="otis_cobb.html">Otis Cobb</a> seized complete control of the <a href="farsight_colony.html">Farsight Colony</a>. During the Mutiny, Captain <a href="william_garrett.html">William Garrett</a> and the expeditionary <a href="marine.html">Marines</a> were killed, along with many <a href="laborer_human.html">Laborers</a>, much of the <a href="farsight_expedition.html">Farsight Expedition</a>'s command staff, and several civilians.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Background</div>

				<p>In the weeks leading up to the Mutiny, Otis Cobb received what he believed to be prophetic visions of an impending <a href="destroyers.html">Destroyer</a> attack on <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>, which that would annihilate the Farsight Colony. He was convinced that Destroyers had noticed the arrival of the <a href="interstellar_propulsion_system.html">ISPS</a> in the <a href="lumen.html">Lumen</a> system, and had mobilized their planet razing machinery against the presumptuous colonists.</p>

				<p>When the construction of the <a href="sanctuary.html">Sanctuary</a> was complete, Cobb was assured by the <a href="presence.html">Presence</a> that the time had come for him to lead his people to their new home. There they would be safe from the Destroyers, and free of Earth's pride and oppression.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Mutiny</div>

				<p>On the morning of #DATE, the day after the full civilian population was brought out of stasis, and while Garrett and the command crew were in a staff meeting aboard the <a href="argo.html">Argo</a>, Cobb and several Laborers stormed the Colony's <a href="communications_bunker.html">Communications Bunker</a>, wielding makeshift weapons adapted from mining equipment. With the Bunker secured, Cobb was able to prevent any message of the Mutiny from reaching Earth. He delivered a <a href="labor_society.html">Labor Society</a> manifesto over the Colony intercom, saying that the Destroyers who razed the surface of Lumen 2 would return, and that ties to Earth and her pride would be the Colony's downfall. Cobb stationed guards at the entrances to the Colony to prevent anyone from leaving, and ordered Laborers to begin rounding up civilians. Captured personnel were held in the unfinished <a href="rec_center.html">Rec Center</a>.</p>

				<p>From the Argo, Commander Garrett and communications officer <a href="karl_westfahl.html">Karl Westfahl</a> were unable to interrupt Cobb's preaching. Garrett pulled up camera footage from the Colony, and saw bewildered colonists being herded into the Rec Center. He called <a href="marco_badawi.html">Marco Badawi</a>, and ordered him to recall all <a href="marine.html">Marines</a> from their current surface assignments for possible action. Garrett attempted to negotiate with Cobb, who ignored his attempts at communication. Over the intercom Cobb proclaimed that anyone who resisted the Labor Society would be killed.</p>

				<p>Seeing no other alternative for regaining control of the Colony, Garrett ordered Bravo and Charlie squads to enter the Colony from the front and top, and engage any foes that presented a credible threat with lethal force. Both squads breached the Colony successfully, but were met with ambushes as they moved through it toward the Communications Bunker and the Rec Center. Though the Laborers had inferior weaponry, they greatly outnumbered the Marines. Additionally, Cobb, as a <a href="vessel.html">Vessel</a> carrying one of <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a>'s <a href="lesser_fragment.html">Lesser Fragments</a>, was able to sense the presence and intent of his enemies, allowing his Laborers to outmaneuver the Marines in their encounters. The Marines of Bravo and Charlie squads were defeated, and those who were captured were executed.</p>

				<p>After the Labor Society's victory inside the Colony, Laborers quickly emerged and forced Badawi and Alpha squad to retreat into the Argo. Cobb demanded that Garrett surrender, promising that if he did so willingly, all aboard the Argo would be spared. Garrett threatened to detonate the Argo's remaining antimatter fuel supply if Cobb attempted to board the Argo, but Karl Westfahl learned from <a href="jessica_arai.html">Jessica Arai</a> that Garrett's threat was idle.</p>

				<p>After eighteen hours at an impasse, Karl Westfahl, who had secretly negotiated his own safety and reward with Cobb, opened the doors to the Argo from a terminal during a supply run to the <a href="argo.html#provisions_deck">Provisions Deck</a>. The Laborers entered, and overwhelmed the Marines covering the doors. Garrett, having seen the Laborers execute many of their captives, insisted that Jessica Arai hide in one of the stasis pods on the upper <a href="argo.html#hibernation_decks">Hibernation Deck</a>.</p>

				<p>With Jessica in long-term metabolic stasis, the Fragment that Cobb bore could not detect her brain activity. When Laborers finally reached the <a href="argo.html#command_deck">Command Deck</a>, all Marines and command crew members other than Westfahl had been killed or captured. Those captured were taken out of the Argo, and later executed in front of the remaining Expedition members and civilians. Jessica Arai remained in <a href="cryostasis.html">Cryostasis</a> for several hundred years longer than was considered safe.</p>
				
				<div class="entry-section-title">Aftermath</div>

				<p>After the Mutiny, Cobb wiped <a href="cici.html">CICI's</a> memory banks so that no record of the colonists' fate or whereabouts could be retreived by future rescuers. The Laborers gathered necessary supplies from the Colony, and allowed colonists to retrieve some personal items under guard. All those killed during the Mutiny were piled east of the Argo and burned, and their ashen remains were dispersed. The colonists were then forced to congregate near the entrance to the <a href="mine.html">Mine</a>.

				<p>Once Cobb no longer sensed any conscious or unconscious minds in the Colony or aboard the Argo, the colonists were ushered by the Laborers down into the lowest mineshaft, and from there down the winding stairs which led to the Sanctuary. The Colonists began to experience bouts of <a href="cave_sickness.html">Cave Sickness</a> as they moved toward their new home. Cobb blasted the mineshaft closed behind the group, symbolically and literally isolating the colonists from the Farsight Colony and from Earth.</p>

				<p>Jessica Arai remained in her Stasis Pod aboard the Argo, while <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> remained in sleep mode until awakened by CICI's emergency summons.</p>
