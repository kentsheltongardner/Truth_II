				<p>The Shame was a painful memory, shared by all <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a> of the <a href="high_lineage.html">High Lineages</a>. Most Natives considered it to be the darkest of all chapters on the ancient <a href="chain_of_memory.html">Chain of Memory</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">The Shame</div>

				<p>During the <a href="pre_tribal_extinction.html">Pre-Tribal Extinction</a>, many surface species were annihilated, the <a href="migration.html">Migration</a> was scattered, and food became scarce in the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>. Many creatures, even the <a href="old_god.html">Old Gods</a>, found themselves fighting desparately to survive. Of the many Lumene Natives that dwelt in the <a href="womb.html">Womb</a>, only two survived.</p>

				<p>One Native took shelter near a hidden pool, later called the <a href="laborers_pool.html">Laborer's Pool</a>, and entered <a href="dormancy.html">Dormancy</a> there. This Native hid itself so well that no Beast or Cryptfly ever found it, and it was only in the <a href="age.html">Enlightened Age</a> that it was discovered by a pioneering <a href="explorer.html">Explorer</a>.</p>

				<p>The other Native remained active, and continued to seek food and opportunity. As it scoured the Underground for prey and carrion, it became cornered with several of its young by an Old God, in a chamber later called the <a href="dark_room.html">Dark Room</a>. The massive creature was desparate with hunger, and the Native had no offering to give it.</p>

				<p>After a brief inner struggle, the Native dimmed its lights and fled, hoping to satiate the Old God with the offering of its children. The Native escaped and survived, and one of its later descendants was the <a href="common_ancestor.html">Common Ancestor</a>, from whom all the High Lineages descended.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Responses</div>

				<p>All Lumene Natives of the High Lineages wrestled with the Shame, for each remembered it with clarity. Most Natives abandoned worship of the Old Gods, preferring abstract objects of praise. The <a href="philosopher.html">Philosophers</a> debated the rationality and morality of their ancestor's choice, and many argued it was the correct one under the circumstances. The <a href="adventurer.html">Adventurers</a> determined to never again find themselves in such a position of weakness before an enemy. The <a href="nurturer.html">Nurturers</a> chose to forever tend to all weak creatures, to atone for their Shame. The <a href="laborer.html">Laborers</a>, however, did not carry the Shame with them.</p>
