				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Farmland was an expansive region of the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>, beneath the <a href="frontier.html">Frontier</a> and east of the <a href="magma_chamber.html">Magma Chambers</a>, which served as the <a href="lineage.html#farmer">Farmers</a>' <a href="locus.html">Locus</a>. From the <a href="age.html#enlightened">Enlightened Age</a> until the <a href="age.html#dark">Dark Age</a>, most of the <a href="kindred.html">Kindred</a>'s food was cultivated in the Farmland, either in the <a href="#upper_root_fields">Upper Root Fields</a>, the <a href="#fly_traps">Fly Traps</a>, or the <a href="#flesh_vats">Flesh Vats</a>.</p>

				<p>The majority of the Farmland was open to all <a href="lineage.html">Lineages</a> of the Kindred. The lower portion, called the <a href="#enclave">Enclave</a>, was home to a secretive sect of Farmers called the '<a href="faithful.html">Faithful</a>', who did not readily admit outsiders.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Areas</div>

				<a id="distribution_center"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Distribution Center</div>

				<p>The Distribution Center was a <a href="flow.html">Flow</a> refinement, packaging and shipping center operated by <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> <a href="lineage.html#farmer">Farmers</a>. The Distribution Center contained receiving funnels for unrefined Flow, distillation and boiling vats, storage silos, miles of tubing, conveyors, baking furnaces, and packaging equipment. Workers processed Flow into various products ready for distribution throughout the <a href="realm.html">Realm</a>, such as distilled liquid Flow, concentrates, powders, solid bars and moulded figures. Bulk products were shipped in cylindrical and cubical containers of various sizes.</p>

				<p>When the Distribution Center was constructed in the <a href="age.html#planetary">Planetary Age</a>, Farmers comprised the majority of its workforce. During the <a href="age.html#hidden">Hidden Age</a> <a href="lineage.html#laborer">Laborers</a> were encouraged to participate in simple tasks in the Distribution Center, such as machine operation and product transport.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> enters the darkened Distribution Center from below once it has the <a href="../items.html#volt_gun">Volt Gun</a>. CT-41 navigates through the Distribution Center, using the Volt Gun to power equipment and doors via wiring exposed by <a href="../creatures.html#vermin">Vermin</a>. After an arduous journey CT-41 emerges from the Distribution Center and is able to move west toward the <a href="highway.html">Highway</a>.</p>

				<a id="enclave"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Enclave</div>

				<p>The Enclave was a large region near the base of the <a href="#">Farmland</a> where the <a href="faithful.html">Faithful</a> lived.</p>

				<p>During the <a href="tribal_wars.html">Tribal Wars</a>, the <a href="lineage.html#farmer">Farmers</a> living in the Enclave refused to abandon their homes and flee to the west. These hardy <a href="lumene_native.html">Natives</a>, cut off from the <a href="lineage.html#philosopher">Philosophers</a> and their fellow <a href="lineage.html#nurturer">Nurturers</a>, nevertheless defended their homes so ferociously that they singlehandedly halted the <a href="lineage.html#adventurer">Adventurers</a>' downward offensive, directing it westward instead. The line marking the maximal Adventurer advance later marked the upper boundary of the Enclave within the Farmland. In later times the entrance to the Enclave was flanked by the two Defenders, statues of armed and armored Faithful that commemorated the Faithful of old, and warned against incursion.</p>

				<p>During the Tribal Wars, the Farmers living in the Enclave began to call themselves the 'Faithful'. After the Wars, the Faithful lived a life apart from the <a href="kindred.html">Kindred</a> in their reclusive home. No electrical or optical wiring was ever laid in the Enclave. Much of the technology present in the Enclave was fashioned by the Faithful as they patiently encouraged <a href="deep_root.html">Deep Roots</a> to spread and grow, providing warmth and light where needed. Artificial machinery in the Enclave was almost entirely steam driven, using heat from the eaternmost <a href="magma_chamber.html">Magma Chamber</a> for power.</p>

				<p>Within the Enclave were many primitive Native habitations, the <a href="#lower_root_fields">Lower Root Fields</a>, the <a href="#flow_caverns">Flow Caverns</a>, the <a href="#origin">Origin</a>, and <a href="old_god.html#OLD_GOD">#OLD_GOD</a>.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> enters the Enclave after using the <a href="../items.html#impact_cannon">Impact Cannon</a> to destroy one of the cracked Defenders which had fallen across the passageway it symbolically guarded.</p>

				<a id="flesh_vats"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Flesh Vats</div>

				<p>The Flesh Vats were a complex system of vats and tubing where <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a> bred simple aquatic lifeforms for slaughter and consumption. The Flesh Vats were originally designed by <a href="lineage.html#farmer">Farmers</a> and <a href="lineage.html#engineer">Engineers</a> after the <a href="tribal_wars.html">Tribal Wars</a>, so that the <a href="lineage.html#adventurer">Adventurers</a> would have a constant source of meat to supplement their diet. The <a href="lineage.html#warrior">Warriors</a> and <a href="lineage.html#explorer">Explorers</a> originally rotated through shifts managing the Flesh Vats, but after the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a> the responsibility fell to other <a href="lineage.html">Lineages</a>, and eventually to the <a href="lineage.html#laborer">Laborers</a> exclusively.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> finds the <a href="companion.html#follower">Follower</a> dead between two Flesh Vats.</p>

				<a id="flow_caverns"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Flow Caverns</div>

				<p>The Flow Caverns were secluded chambers where the <a href="faithful.html">Faithful</a> stored the <a href="flow.html">Flow</a> they harvested from the <a href="#lower_root_fields">Lower Root Fields</a>. The Flow was allowed to age in the Flow Caverns until its bitter poisons evaporated and it became edible. The Faithful maintained the Caverns with an enormous surplus of Flow to prepare themselves against seasonal shortages, theft or warfare, and the sicknesses and possible death of the <a href="#origin">Origin</a>.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> navigates through the viscous Flow of the Chambers, and discovers the Rutile Statue, the only Native left to protect the coveted Flow.</p>

				<a id="fly_traps"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Fly Traps</div>

				<p>The Fly Traps were chambers, east of the <a href="#upper_root_fields">Upper Root Fields</a>, where <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> <a href="lineage.html#farmer">Farmers</a> lured the small and fearful <a href="../creatures.html#sapsucker">Sapsuckers</a> of the <a href="division.html#deep">Deep</a> <a href="wild.html">Wild</a>.</p>

				<p>Ancient Farmers learned in the <a href="age.html#tribal">Tribal Age</a> to entice their opportunistic prey with offerings of <a href="flow.html">Flow</a> and soothing patterns of light. As the greedy creatures ate Flow from feeders, Farmers produced hypnotizing ritual lightshows. The Sapsuckers learned to associate the light shows with food, and soon followed the Farmers wherever their lights led.</p>

				<p>Knowledge of the Farmer's lights and rich Flow were passed from Sapsucker parents to children for generations, until the Sapsuckers were heavily dependent on the Farmers, and immediately and compulsively responded to their lights. The Farmers did not gorge themselves on Sapsuckers, however, and maintained a large population of them, culling them only when their population grew beyond what the Farmers' Flow could maintain.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> enters the caverns where the Farmers built their now empty Fly Traps, but only finds dead or dormant Sapsuckers there.</p>

				<a id="lower_root_fields"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Lower Root Fields</div>

				<p>The Lower Root Fields were natural caverns above the easternmost <a href="magma_chamber.html">Magma Chamber</a> where the <a href="faithful.html">Faithful</a> tended <a href="deep_root.html">Deep Roots</a>, and harvested the <a href="flow.html">Flow</a> they produced. The Faithful cleared predators from chambers where they wished Deep Roots to grow, and prevented <a href="overgrowth.html">Overgrowths</a> from forming, but otherwise did not manufacture artificial environments for growth. Many of the Faithful chose to release their hold on life in their western Root Field, so that the Deep Roots could encompass them in death.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> passes through the Lower Root Fields, and sees many Deep Roots in the form of <a href="lumene_native.html">Natives</a>. Although these Root Fields have grown wild, there is still something of the Faithful's artistry to be seen in the Deep Root growths.</p>

				<a id="origin"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Origin</div>

				<p>The Origin was a gigantic layering of bulbous nodes from which emanated all true <a href="deep_root.html">Deep Roots</a>. While each bulb or growth of the Deep Roots possessed a sort of intelligence, the Origin was the oldest and wisest of them all. The Origin directed the growth of Deep Roots throughout the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>, and skilled <a href="faithful.html">Faithful</a>, such as the <a href="companion.html#groundskeeper">Groundskeeper</a>, were able to interpret its intentions and gauge its health.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> visits the Origin, but is only able to see a portion at any given moment, since the entire organism is larger than CT-41's field of view. CT-41 may attempt to attack the Origin, and though the Origins lights may flicker angrily and change color, it does not take any damage and cannot be destroyed.</p>

				<a id="repair_shop"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Repair Shop</div>

				<p>The Repair Shop was a workshop where <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> <a href="lineage.html#farmer">Farmers</a> serviced, improved and replaced their equipment.The Repair Shop contained various welding, cutting, and reshaping tools, as well as spare parts and material stores. The <a href="faithful.html">Faithful</a> did not come to the Repair Shop.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> enters the Repair Shop, and sees many pieces of machinery in all states of direpair and disassembly. Near the back of the Repair Shop CT-41 finds the <a href="../items.html#cyclone_drive">Cyclone Drive</a>, a motor that it can equip to increase the torque at its wheels, and its maximum speed.</p>

				<a id="upper_root_fields"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Upper Root Fields</div>

				<p>The Upper Root Fields were long, flat chambers where <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> <a href="farmer.html">Farmers</a> cultivated <a href="deep_root.html">Deep Roots</a>. The Farmers designed the Root Fields so that Deep Roots could emerge, spread, and produce large amounts of <a href="flow.html">Flow</a>. An ideal Root Field was very warm, very humid, and had a flat floor with large, evenly spaced holes drilled into it so the Deep Roots could take hold and produce tendrils. Moisture in the air was produced by boiling water in cisterns deep beneath the floor, near the <a href="magma_chamber.html">Magma Chambers</a>. The evaporated water condensed on drip spikes attached to the ceiling, and fell in a continual cycle that allowed the Deep Roots to thrive. The cisterns and runoff drains in the Root Fields were connected via tubing to the <a href="sea.html">Sea</a>.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> was able to easily navigate the western Root Fields, where the Deep Roots were relatively tame. As it navigated east the Root Fields and Native machinery were overrun by various Deep Root growths, including the <a href="overgrowth.html">Overgrowth</a> that enveloped the Altar to the east.</p>
