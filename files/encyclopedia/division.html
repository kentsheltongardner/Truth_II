				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>Divisions were broad categories into which <a href="lumene_native.html">Natives</a> of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a> separated the matter and biomes of their world. The four largest divisions were the <a href="#emptiness">Emptiness</a>, the <a href="#shallows">Shallows</a>, the <a href="#deep">Deep</a>, and the <a href="#underworld">Underworld</a>.</p>

				<p>After the first <a href="proto_native.html">Proto-Natives</a> emerged from pools of the <a href="womb.html">Womb</a>, Lumene Natives spread rapidly to the Deep and the Shallows. During the <a href="age.html#planetary">Planetary</a> and <a href="age.html#stellar">Stellar Ages</a>, Lumene Natives also lived in the Emptiness. For most of recorded Lumene history, <a href="lineage.html#adventurer">Adventurers</a> lived in or near the Shallows, while <a href="lineage.html#philosopher">Philosophers</a> and <a href="lineage.html#nurturer">Nurturers</a> lived in the Deep.</p>

				<a id="emptiness"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Emptiness</div>

				<p>The Emptiness was a Division of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>, extending from the surface of the planet to the top of the atmosphere. Most <a href="lumene_native.html">Natives</a> felt an innate distrust and fear of the Emptiness. They found its openness to be disorienting, having adapted over evolutionary timescales to life in enclosed spaces. The Emptiness could also be an objectively dangerous environment, due to the extreme temperature variations of the Lumene night and day.</p>

				<p>The <a href="lineage.html#explorer">Explorers</a> were the first Native <a href="lineage.html">Lineage</a> to brave the Emptiness, waiting for the relative safety of the Lumene dawn and twilight to venture out onto the surface of Lumen 2. By constructing artificial caverns and tunnels on the surface, pioneering Explorers helped other Natives to tolerate the Emptiness, and leave the ancestral <a href="locus.html">Loci</a> surrounding the <a href="womb.html">Womb</a>.</p>

				<p>Most Lumene Natives considered the Emptiness to begin wherever there was no natural stone of soil roof overhead, and to then extend upward to the top of Lumen 2's atmosphere.</p>

				<a id="shallows"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Shallows</div>
				
				<p>The Shallows were a Division of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>, beginning at the surface of the planet, and ending at the depth where surface temperature changes were no longer significant factors in the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>. Though the boundary between the Shallows and the <a href="#deep">Deep</a> was difficult to establish precisely, most <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a> understood the areas above the <a href="sea.html">Sea</a> to be the Shallows, and areas below to be the Deep.</p>

				<p>Living conditions were generally less comfortable for Lumene Natives in the Shallows than in the Deeps, due to the significant variance in temperature, and periodic changes in the availability of food. Before the <a href="age.html#planetary">Planetary Age</a>, only <a href="lineage.html#warrior">Warriors</a> and <a href="lineage.html#explorer">Explorers</a> chose to live in the Shallows. The food chain of the Shallows was linked to surface life: predators from the Shallows often hunted for prey in the <a href="#emptiness">Emptiness</a>, and vice versa.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> enters the crust of Lumen 2 and explores much of the Shallows circling and beneath the <a href="fortuna_crater.html">Fortuna Crater</a>. It can make its way into the Shallows via the <a href="mine.html">Mine</a>, the <a href="caverns.html">Caverns</a>, and the <a href="farsight_colony.html">Farsight Colony</a>.</p>

				<a id="deep"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Deep</div>

				<p>The Deep was a Division of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>, located between the <a href="#underworld">Underworld</a> and the <a href="#shallows">Shallows</a>. The biome of the Deep was sustained from the bottom by <a href="deep_root.html">Deep Roots</a> and other thermosynthetic autotrophs. The warmth rising from the Underworld was essential to these lifeforms, and by extension the entire web of life in the Deep. Some <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> researchers believed that life on Lumen 2 began in the Deep, and credited the constant warmth and humidity with its emergence.</p>

				<p>Many Lumene historians interpreted the <a href="tribal_wars.html">Tribal Wars</a> as a contest between the Shallows and the Deep. They argued that pre-industrial <a href="lineage.html#adventurer">Adventurers</a> were not yet able to fully sustain themselves in the Shallows, and had to return to the Deep to survive. Only after uniting with the tribes of the Deep during the Unification were the tribes of the Shallows finally able to establish a permanent presence for the <a href="kindred.html">Kindred</a> in the Emptiness.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> first enters the Deep as it moves into <a href="farmland.html#no_mans_land">No Man's Land</a>. It discovers the vast scale of the extinct Native civilization, and during later explorations learns that much of the western Deep is dominated by <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a> and his <a href="fragment.html">Fragments</a>.</p>

				<a id="underworld"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Underworld</div>

				<p>The Underworld was a Division of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>, consisting of the planet's upper mantle and the underside of the crust. The upper mantle was a fluid shell, composed of magma much more viscous than that found beneath Earth's crust. It was home to a rich but bizarre ecosystem, with the <a href="magma_worm.html">Magma Worms</a> dominating the biome. These enormous beasts swam slowly through the Underworld, and birthed their young, along with entire eco-systems, in the cooler <a href="magma_chamber.html">Magma Chambers</a> that dotted the bottom of the crust. In addition to the Magma Chambers, the named regions of the Underworld were the Undercurrent and the Shelf.</p>

				<p>Many early Native religions centered around worship of the Underworld as the constant, lifegiving source of warmth, opposing the treacherous <a href="#emptiness">Emptiness</a> above. The <a href="worshipper.html">Worshippers</a> carved out their own tombs at incredible depths in the <a href="catacombs.html">Catacombs</a>, believing that by so doing they could inter themselves close to the Gods of the Underworld.</p>

				<p>During the events of Truth II <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> enters the Underworld from the Magma Chambers or from the main vent of the <a href="volcano.html">Volcano</a>, but even with its best shielding and armor it is unable to navigate the Underworld for extended periods without suffering catastrophic failure.</p>
