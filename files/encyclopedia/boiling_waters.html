Owing to its proximity to the Magma Chamber, the Waters were extremely hot, and were lethal to unprotected <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a>.</p>

				<p>Shortly before the <a href="subjugation.html">Subjugation</a>, and under <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme's</a> direction, Lumene <a href="lineage.html#laborer">Laborers</a> began digging a tunnel from the Boiling Waters to the <a href="lineage.html#ruler">Rulers'</a> <a href="locus.html">Locus</a>. When he deemed that the time was right, Thosmodeme instructed his Laborers to seal and flood the Locus, and destroy the Rulers and <a href="executor.html">Executors</a>. His plan succeeded, and the Rulers were boiled alive in their home.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> passes through the Boiling Waters en route to the Rulers' Locus, taking care to avoid long term exposure to its damaging and corrosive waters, and avoiding the hardy and dangerous lifeforms that had evolved to thrive in them.</p>
