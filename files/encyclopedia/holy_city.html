				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Holy City was a region of the Lumene <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>, in the western <a href="division.html#deep">Deep</a>, set among the Briar Patch. During the latter half of the <a href="age.html#hidden">Hidden Age</a>, <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> <a href="lineage.html#laborer">Laborers</a> under the influence of <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a> cleared, developed, occupied, and beautified the City. Until the end of the Hidden Age, and well into the <a href="age.html#dark">Dark Age</a>, the Laborers lived in the Holy City, and when they died out, the Holy City became the abode of Thosmodeme's chosen <a href="servant.html">Servants</a>.</p>

				<p>The construction of the Holy City began shortly after Thosmodeme began to make contact with the minds of Laborers. Playing on their greivances, real or imagined, Thosmodeme urged the Laborers to claim their own <a href="locus.html">Locus</a>. The Briar Patch just beneath the <a href="refuge.html">Refuge</a> were Thosmodeme's choice for their new home.</p>

				<p>For Ages, Native planners had considered the Briar Patch to be unsuitable for Native habitation. The first Laborers to relocate to the Wastes were dismayed at the sight of their new abode. The plant life was thorned, tough, and had little nutrional value, the climate was uncomfortably warm, the wildlife was territorial, the bedrock was unstable, the region was prone to seismic disturbance, and the waters from the <a href="#aquifer">Aquifer</a> were tainted. In their occasional moments of autonomy, some Laborers doubted Thosmodeme's wisdom, and their own ability.</p>

				<p>Yet the Tyrant promised the Laborers that the Briar Patch would become their Holy City, and urged them to gather from across the <a href="realm.html">Realm</a>. He inspired their minds and drove their bodies relentlessly, granting vigor, focus, and intelligence beyond their natural capacities as they cleared the land. The Laborers imported huge stones from the <a href="commons.html#quarry">Quarry</a> to serve as solid foundations for their developments. This resolute and herculean effort gladdened the <a href="lineage.html#nurturer">Nurturers</a>, but perplexed and alarmed the <a href="lineage.html#philosopher">Philosophers</a>.</p>

				<p>By Thosmodeme's design, the Laborers built their City to be self-sufficient. Thorns were cleared from inhabited areas, and selectively bred to yield Pulp. Water from the Aquifer was passed through slabs of filtering stone before entering the system of aqueducts that ran through the City. Laborers from the Refuge domesticated local fauna, while others from the <a href="farmland.html">Farmland</a> cultivated aquatic foods in the <a href="#feeding_pools">Feeding Pools</a>.</p>

				<p> After a quarter-<a href="lumene_timekeeping.html">Turn</a> of effort, Laborers completed the <a href="#residential_sectors">Residential Sectors</a> of the Holy City, and were able to live in a technologically simple society, independent of the <a href="kindred.html">Kindred</a>. All residents of the Holy City accepted and lived by Thosmodeme's doctrine of <a href="purification.html">Purification</a>, which evolved as the Turns passed. The Laborers began to beautify their new home with religious devotion, and constructed Thosmodeme's <a href="temple.html">Temple</a> within it. Under his tutelage, many Laborers became excellent masons and sculptors, and Thosmodeme's austere residence was nevertheless a beautiful one.</p>

				<p>All throughout the construction of the Holy City, and especially during the building of the Temple, Laborers were unable or unwilling to share their motivations and methods with Natives of the <a href="lineage.html#high_lineage">High Lineages</a>. The <a href="lineage.html#ruler">Rulers</a> especially regarded this unwillingness to communicate with suspicion. Nevertheless, the Laborers' actions violated no law, and the Nurturers applauded the Laborers' completion of their new home.</p>

				<p>After the <a href="uprising.html">Uprising</a>, and without any surviving Native inhabitants, the Holy City became a dwelling and breeding ground for Thosmodeme's choicest Servants. Many of the halls and chambers became again overgrown with Thorns, and the once great kingdom of Thosmodeme was peopled by animals only. Not until humans arrived on <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a> in #YEAR did Thosmodeme take any more <a href="child.html">Children</a> as his own, but these he housed in the <a href="sanctuary.html">Sanctuary</a>, as they were very ill suited to life in the Holy City.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> enters and passes through the Holy City, finding the <a href="../items.html#time_crystals">Time Crystals</a> in the <a href="#tribute_chamber">Tribute Chamber</a> before entering the <a href="#well_of_offering">Well Of Offering</a> and confronting Thosmodeme in the <a href="#throneroom">Throneroom</a>.</p>

			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Areas</div>
				<a id="antechamber"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Antechamber</div>

				<p>The Antechamber was a large hall through which <a href="vessel.html">Vessels</a>, <a href="servant.html">Servants</a>, <a href="fragment.html">Fragments</a> and <a href="children.html">Children</a> entered the <a href="#throne_room">Throne Room</a>. The Antechamber contained many pillars and statues depicting <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a> in service and supplication, and had several flights of steps leading upward toward the <a href="#supplicants_door">Supplicant's Door</a>.</p>

				<a id="aquifer"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Aquifer</div>

				<p>The Aquifer was a large, low-ceilinged chamber that provided water to the <a href="#">Holy City</a> via an extensive system of aqueducts. During the construction of the Holy City, <a href="lumene_native.html">Natives</a> <a href="lineage.html#laborer">Laborers</a> created a temporary dwelling near the Aquifer, which they abandoned once the <a href="#residential_sectors">Residential Sectors</a> were completed.</p>
				
				<a id="correction_cells"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Correction Cells</div>

				<p>The Correction Cells were rooms within the <a href="#">Holy City</a> where <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a> held captive <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a> that he found difficult to control. They were sensory deprivation rooms, nearer to Thosmodeme himself than the Native <a href="locus.html">Loci</a>, designed to completely isolate rebellious Natives. Thosmodeme forced those <a href="children.html">Children</a> confined in his Correction Cells to experience his correct thoughts through the process of <a href="purification.html">Purification</a>. By doing so, he hoped to alter the Child's neural configuration over time, producing a more docile and malleable being. Willful Natives remained in the Correction Cells until Thosmodeme's thoughts became synonymous with their own.</p>

				<a id="feeding_pools"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Feeding Pools</div>

				<p>The Feeding Pools were several interconnected bodies of water in the bottom-eastern quadrant of the <a href="#">Holy City</a>. Although the water of the Feeding Pools was unfit for bathing or drinking, it was the breeding ground for billions of chemosynthetic autotrophic lifeforms. These microbes, and others that preyed on them, were the main food source of the <a href="lineage.html#laborer">Laborers</a> that built the Holy City, and the <a href="servant.html">Servants</a> that lived there after the <a href="uprising.html">Uprising</a>.</p>

				<p>During <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, when <a href="ct-41.html">CT-41</a> visits the Feeding Pools, it finds nets, growth lattices, and other simple cultivation and harvesting equipment left by Natives under <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a>'s influence.</p>

				<a id="forge"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Forge</div>

				<p>The Forge was a smelting and fashioning workshop at the top-western corner of the <a href="#temple">Temple</a>. It connected to the <a href="deep_ruins.html#labyrinth">Labyrinth</a>, where <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a>'s <a href="servant.html">Servants</a> and wayward <a href="child.html">Children</a> mined iron ores. Within the Forge Thosmodeme's subordinates fashioned simple tools and structural elements for his kingdom. In Thosmodeme's religion of escalating <a href="purification.html">Purification</a>, forced labor in the Forge preceded confinement to <a href="#correction_cells">Correction Cells</a>.</p>

				<a id="gathering_place"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Gathering Place</div>

				<p>The Gathering Place was a huge vaulted ampitheatre in the <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a>'s <a href="temple.html">Temple</a> where Thosmodeme enraptured enormous congregations of his <a href="children.html">Children</a> in various periodic rituals of enlightenment. A tall stone pillar rose from the floor of the ampitheater. Rebellious or struggling Children were often placed atop the pillar during gatherings the weight of congregation's collective submission to Thosmodeme. Several stone platforms hung supended from the ceiling of the Gathering Place, and were accessible via a network of tunnels above the chamber.</p>

				<a id="residential_sectors"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Residential Sectors</div>

				<p>The Residential Sectors of the <a href="#">Holy City</a> were the largest and most densely populated of all <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> excavations, built and peopled by the numerous <a href="lineage.html#laborer">Laborers</a> of the <a href="age.html#hidden">Hidden Age</a>. Habitations in the Residential Sectors were compact and simple, but were not dilapidated or squalid. The Residential Sectors contained communal pools, aqueducts carrying falling waters, simple machinery, domesticated lighting animals, and pervasive stylized decorative stone from the <a href="commons.html#quarry">Quarry</a>.</p>

				<p>The upper Residential Sector was peopled primarily by Laborers who had previously lived with the <a href="lineage.html#healer">Healers</a>, while the lower Residential Sector housed emigrees from the <a href="farmland.html">Farmland</a> and the <a href="hearth.html">Heart</a>. The residents of the upper Sector bred and cared for lower Lumene creatures in the <a href="#servants_quarters">Servants' Quarters</a>, while Laborers from the lower Sector cultivated produce and meat in the <a href="#feeding_pools">Feeding Pools</a>.</p>

				<a id="servants_quarters"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Servants' Quarters</div>

				<p>The Servants' Quarters were a region of the <a href="#">Holy City</a> where <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> <a href="lineage.html#laborer">Laborers</a> domesticated and bred the indigenous lifeforms of the Briar Patch.</p>

				<a id="suplicants_door"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Supplicant's Door</div>

				<p>The Supplicant's Door was a massive stone barrier that symbolically separated the purity of <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a> from the tainted world outside the <a href="#throne_room">Throne Room</a>. During the <a href="subjugation.html">Subjugation</a>, Thosmodeme occasionally granted his subjects the privilege of coming to the <a href="#antechamber">Antechamber</a> and petitioning him for favor through perfect, proximal <a href="synchronization.html">Synchronization</a>, though the Supplicant's Door always remained firmly shut during such sessions. During the Subjugation the Door was guarded and operated by blinded and fanatical Natives called Initiates. After the <a href="uprising.html">Uprising</a> and the <a href="slaughter.html">Slaughter</a> the Door was attended by a <a href="temple_guard.html">Temple Guard</a>.</p>

				<a id="temple"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Temple</div>

				<p>The Temple was <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a>'s <a href="sanctum.html">Sanctum</a>, and was a large and ornate complex at the center of the <a href="#">Holy City</a> where the worship, rituals, and enforcement of his <a href="purification.html">Purification</a> were conducted. The Temple was by far the large single structure within the City, and contained some of the largest artificially enclosed spaces in the entire <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>. The Temple contained the <a href="#tribute_chamber">Tribute Chamber</a>, <a href="#correction_cells">Correction Cells</a>, <a href="#gathering_place">Gathering Place</a>, <a href="#throne_room">Throne Room</a>, <a href="#well_of_offering">Well Of Offering</a>, <a href="#supplicants_door">Supplicant's Door</a>, and <a href="#antechamber">Antechamber</a>.</p>

				<a id="throne_room"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Throne Room</div>

				<p>The Throne Room was a large and intricately adorned chamber at the lower west end of the <a href="#temple">Temple</a>, above and to the east of the <a href="labyrinth.html">Labyrinth</a>. <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a> maintained his physical form in the Throne Room, and there his <a href="presence.html">Presence</a> could be felt most keenly. The Throneroom had a high, vaulted ceiling, and a mighty pyramidal throne from which Thosmodeme directed his kingdom. East of the throne was a pool into which the <a href="willing.html">Willing</a> fell from the <a href="#well_of_offering">Well Of Offering</a>. At the eastern end of the Throneroom was the enormous stone <a href="#supplicants_door">Supplicant's Door</a>.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct-41.html">CT-41</a> enters the Throne Room via the Well of Offering, and confronts Thosmodeme, the Tyrant. After CT-41's battle with Thosmodeme and subsequent flight from <a href="voronash.html">Voronash</a>, the Throneroom was changed. Voronash tore a new entrance into the Throneroom from the west, and after chasing the Caretaker toward the <a href="lower_ruins.html">Lower Ruins</a>, broke down the Supplicant's Door.</p>

				<a id="tribute_chamber"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Tribute Chamber</div>

				<p>The Tribute Chamber was a large hall in <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a>'s <a href="#temple">Temple</a> where his more devoted <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> <a href="children.html">Children</a> voluntarily abandoned items that they had previously believed to be of great value. The Tribute Chamber was guarded by a <a href="temple_guard.html">Temple Guard</a>, and contained the <a href="../items.html#time_crystals">Time Crystals</a> brought by a forgotten <a href="lineage.html#engineer">Engineer</a>.</p>

				<a id="well_of_offering"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Well Of Offering</div>

				<p>The Well Of Offering was an ornate stone aperture in <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a>'s <a href="#temple">Temple</a>, partially spanned by a jutting half of a bridge. The Well led down to a pool in Thosmodeme's <a href="#throne_room">Throne Room</a>. As their physical lives came to an end, Thosmodeme's <a href="children.html">Children</a> were escorted to the mouth of the Well, and the <a href="willing.html">Willing</a> threw themselves in, before falling into the pool and being devoured by their lord. The Unwilling were forcibly taken away, and given to <a href="voronash.html">Voronash</a> in the <a href="pit.html">Pit</a>.</p>
