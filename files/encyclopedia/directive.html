				<p>The Directive was vast and evolving belief system that guided the <a href="destroyer.html">Destroyers</a>.</p>

				<p>The Directive began as a simple but overriding command, programmed into the <a href="architect.html">Architects</a>' service robots on one of their failed colonial world in the Centaurus terminus. At its core, the Directive stated that the robots must serve and obey their creators, the Architects. After all the Architects in the colony were dead, the intelligent service robots had to decide for themselves how best to follow the Directive. As no Architects were present, the highly enterprising robots determined that they needed to contact their creators in order to obey them.</p>

				<p>Using supplies available in the colony, the robots began to build up the infrastructure necessary to comply with the now amplified Directive. The robots analyzed themselves and the colony, and learned what they could of technology. The Directive expanded further as they concluded that they must survive and reproduce in order to serve their creators. They decided that they must also leave the colony world eventually, and seek out the Architects on their homeworld.</p>

				<p>The robots worked together to build up society in its various stages on their inhospitable world. The Directive was continually broadened and modified, and its proper interpretation was passed on to each new generation of constructs. As the Directive grew, large Destroyer computers worked ceaselessly, consuming enormous amounts of energy, to ensure that the Directive remained free of contradiction.</p>

				<p>Eventually many robotic forms were developed for specific tasks, as robots guided by the Directive spread across the world. After almost one million years had passed, the new race spread from its dead world to the planets in their system, and then to nearby stars.</p>

				<p>After scanning many systems for the Architects, the robots encountered a fledgling interplanetary species. Using what few clues they had available to them, they determined that these were not their creators. Collectively the race of robots determined that the proper interpretation of the Directive, in light of the new circumstance, was to annihilate the species.</p>

				<p>The robots reasoned that any species whose behavior was not predictable was a chaotic potential threat to them, and to the Architects. If either they or the Architects were destroyed, it would be impossible to follow the Directive, so the threat must be removed. They obliterated the species, and thus became Destroyers.</p>

				<p>Hundreds of millions of years before <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a> or humans achieved sentience, Destroyers had already searched every star system in the galaxy for signs of the Architects, without success. For each new circumstance the Destroyers encountered the interpretation of the Directive was modified and expanded, until it was an enormous and many layered collection of appropriate behaviors.</p>

				<p>As Destroyer subgroups became isolated from each other over hundreds of thousands of years, differing versions of the Directive naturally emerged. Occasionally groups of Destroyers with differing Directives came into contact, resulting in the galaxy's most destructive wars, called Schisms. Only after one victorious faction developed tunneling technology did the Schisms end, as distant Destroyer constructs were able to collaboratively maintain a single interpretation of the Directive.</p>

				<p>When the Destroyers concluded that the Architects were nowhere to be found, they abandoned their search, but the Directive still called for other actions. Destroyer sensor stations, Gateways and Stellar Harvesters dotted the galaxy, detecting and exterminating chaotic intelligent life whenever it emerged onto the interstellar stage.</p>

				<p>When the Destroyers discovered the <a href="probe.html">Probes</a> launched by the Native <a href="lineage.html#explorer">Explorers</a>, the sleeping Destroyers awakened, as the Directive called for the annihilation of all intelligent life in the <a href="lumen.html">Lumen</a> system. After intercepting UCA transmissions, the Destroyers, as Manifestations of the Directive, began to wage a War of Extinction against Earth and her colonies.</p>
