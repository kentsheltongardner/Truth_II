				<p>Dormancy was a state of metabolic stasis into which many aerobic Lumene organisms entered when atmospheric conditions were unfavorable for respiration. Certain organisms such as the <a href="old_god.html">Old Gods</a> buried themselves before entering Dormancy, while others such as <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a> secreted a toxic, resinous shell around themselves. On the surface of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>, many creatures who entered dormancy went into near deathlike states at the coming of the frigid night or the burning day, emerging only when a <a href="Mmigration.html">Migration</a> neared.</p>

				<p>During the <a href="pre_tribal_extinction.html">Pre-Tribal Extinction</a> a young <a href="proto_native.html">Proto-Native</a> went into Dormacy in a hidden cavern in the <a href="womb.html">Womb</a>, and lay there undisturbed until the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a>. Native <a href="lineage.html#farmer">Farmers</a> found it when it awakened, and together with the <a href="lineage.html#healer">Healers</a> they encouraged its growth and learning. Descendants of the once dormant Proto-Native became the <a href="lineage.html">Lineage</a> of the <a href="lineage.html#laborer">Laborer</a>.</p>
