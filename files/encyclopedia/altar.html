				Altar which Outsider uses to move back into the past must be cleared (quarry)
				-->

				<p>The Altars were platforms constructed by the <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider</a>, which were able to open <a href="tear.html">Tears</a> in the Walls of <a href="creation.html">Creation</a>. The Altar network, which consisted of the <a href="prime_altar.html">Prime Altar</a> and seven lesser Altars, enabled the near instantaneous transport of matter from one Altar to another. The Outsider constructed these Altars in secret throughout the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>, before revealing their existence to the <a href="remnant.html">Remnant</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">History</div>

				<p>The Prime Altar was the first Altar created by the Outsider, built in his <a href="laboratory.html">Laboratory</a> nestled in the <a href="uraninite_vein.html">Uraninite Vein</a>. It was much larger and more powerful than his other Altars, and no other Natives could teleport to it. The Outsider built the Prime Altar by sacrificing his young upon it, and fatiguing the Walls of Creation as <a href="self.html">Selves</a> left their bodies. Killing hundreds of his children on the Prime Altar, eventually the Walls were weakened enough by the unnatural acts for the Altar to be powered on, opening and stabilizing a Tear. For a brief instant, the Walls of Creation were split open, and the Outsider could peer into the <a href="outside.html">Outside</a>.</p>

				<p>Though the Outsider could peer into the Outside, he could not comprehend it, and he was unwilling to leave Creation to study it himself. Through painstaking experimentation using Lumene creatures and robotic servants called <a href="../creatures.html#watcher">Watchers</a>, the Outsider did discover that space and time do not exist in the usual sense outside of Creation's <a href="law.html">Law</a>. By creating multiple Altars, the Outsider was able to exploit the volatile properties of <a href="the_real.html">The Real</a> to move matter almost immediately from one Altar to another. The Outsider constructed many Altars throughout the Underground, in secret caverns known only to the <a href="explorer.html">Explorers</a>, during periods of normal Dormancy while the Remnant slept.</p>

				<p>Before his return to the Remnant, the Outsider revealed the existence and use of his Altars to the <a href="kindred.html">Kindred</a>, and many <a href="lumene_native.html">Natives</a> began to use them. As the traffic of individuals and goods passing through the Outside increased, and Tears were opened again and again in Creation's Walls, an ancient and powerful <a href="singularity.html">Singularity</a> noticed the openings. When it felt the time was right, the Singularity entered into Creation, and began to learn its Law. The Altars that allowed him to enter ultimately caused the downfall of Native civilization.</p>
				
				<div class="entry-section-title">Operation</div>

				<p>The Outsider's Altars seemed to violate universal laws such as conservation of momentum and the universal speed limit, but this was not actually the case. The Altars produced Tears in Creation's Walls, and matter transported by Altars did not move through Creation at all. While the matter transported by the Altars was inside Creation, its mass was conserved, its velocity was limited, and it was acted upon by force pairs that preserved momentum at all times.</p>
b
				<p>The Altars required less energy to operate, by many orders of magnitude, than <a href="destroyer.html">Destroyer</a> <a href="gateway.html">Gateways</a>, the Native <a href="prototype.html">Prototype</a>, or the <a href="tunnel_drive.html">Tunnel Drive</a> used by the <a href="idf.html">IDF</a>, and were hailed as miracles by the Remnant.</p>
				
				<div class="entry-section-title">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> uses the Altars to move quickly across the vastness of the Underground. It finds an Altar in each of the following areas of the Underground:</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle"><a href="upper_ruins.html">Upper Ruins</a></div>

				<p>This Altar was excavated by <a href="farsight_expedition.html">Farsight</a> archaeologists, and studied by <a href="vadim_kozlov.html">Vadim Kozlov</a> and his team of researchers. It is unobstructed when CT-41 first encounters it.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle"><a href="desolation.html">Desolation</a></div>

				<p>This Altar is buried in rubble and sediment, and is inoperable until cleared.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle"><a href="geothermal_power_station.html">Geothermal Power Station</a></div>

				<p>This Altar is unobstructed, but a large <a href="../creatures.html#vermin">Vermin</a> is sapping power to its chamber. It is inoperable until the Vermin is killed.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle"><a href="root_fields.html">Root Fields</a></div>

				<p>Access to this Altar is obstructed by an <a href="overgrowth.html">Overgrowth</a>, and it is inoperable until the Overgrowth is destroyed.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle"><a href="surgical_complex.html">Surgical Complex</a></div>

				<p>This Altar is covered in dried Native and other remains, and is inoperable until cleared.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle"><a href="waste_chambers.html">Waste Chambers</a></div>

				<p>This Altar is cleared, and accessible to the CT-41 as soon as it restores power to the <a href="realm.html">Realm</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle"><a href="repository.html">Repository</a></div>

				<p>This Altar chamber is flooded with water, and is inoperable until the water is drained.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle"><a href="laboratory.html">Laboratory</a></div>

				<p>The Prime Altar is inaccessible until the end of CT-41's journey, and is not part of the normal Altar network.</p>
