				<p>The Architects were the accidental creators of the <a href="destroyer.html">Destroyers</a>. They do not figure significantly into galactic history after their first failed attempts at interstellar colonization.</p>
				
				<div class="entry-section-title">History</div>

				<p>The Architects were a race of sentient beings living on a perpetually cloudy world in the Centaurus terminus of the Milky Way galaxy. They were a slow and fragile species, but aided by their high intelligence and incredibly long lifespans they rose to dominance on their world. They learned much about the world around them by watching and remembering, while other creatures scurried witlessly about.</p>

				<p>As the eons passed, early Architects became interested in what lay beyond the thick clouds of their world. They spent much of their time designing and building massive structures in order to reach the ceiling, and glimpse what lay behind the curtain. Driven by this curiosity, the Architects became a technologically advanced civilization circa 600 million years BC.</p>

				<p>Against all odds, and after developing countless other supporting technologies, the Architects achieved spaceflight. They discovered that an entire universe of lights existed above the clouds, and they hoped to explore it. Due to their fragile physiology, none of the planets in their solar system were feasible colonization candidates, but the Architects were undeterred. By this time they had constructed physically capable robotic servants, and they launched several large vessels with mixed Architect and robotic crews to the stars.</p>

				<p>All of the Architects' colonization missions failed, most during transit or landing. One colony vessel did arrive and land successfully on a warm telluric world, but after several years fighting against the indifferent brutality of nature, the Architect colonists died of starvation. They left behind a nearly finished colony, and a handful of robotic servants. These servants went on to become the Destroyers, who dominated the galaxy for hundreds of millions of year.</p>

				<p>Back on their homeworld, the Architects admitted defeat in their struggle to move to the stars, and fell out of the interstellar arena. They returned to the slow construction of colossal edifices across the surface of their world, and were unaware of the Destroyers they had unwittingly created.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> speaks to the <a href="companion.html#linguist">Linguist</a>, and discovers that the Destroyers annihilate unpredictable intelligent systems while following their twisted and obsolete <a href="destroyer.html#directive">Directive</a> to serve the Architects.</p>
