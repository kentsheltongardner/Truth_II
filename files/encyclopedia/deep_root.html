				<p>The Deep Roots were tendrils of a thermosynthetic lifeform cultivated by <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> <a href="lineage.html#farmer">Farmers</a>. These stationary plantlike growths thrived using energy sapped from the warmth of the <a href="magma_chamber.html">Magma Chambers</a> beneath them. Deep Root exploratory tendrils crawled across cavern floors and down into the soil or rock, searching for warmth. When the tendrils found significant heat, they began to develop fluid filled bulbs. These bulbs acted as heat exchangers, and helped to produce the energy that drove the Deep Root's metabolism.</p>

				<p>The Farmers extracted, packaged and distributed a thick, nutrient rich fluid from the Deep Roots. This fluid, called <a href="flow.html">Flow</a>, became a staple of the Native diet, and was stored in the <a href="farmland.html#flow_silo">Flow Silos</a> or <a href="farmland.html#flow_pool">Flow Pools</a>.</p>

				<p>When left untended for long periods, Deep Roots occasionally formed enormous and dangerous structures called <a href="overgrowth.html">Overgrowths</a>. Part of the Farmers' work involved cutting back concentrated Deep Root growth to prevent Overgrowths from forming, and encouraging the spread of exploratory tendrils.</p>

				<p>Long before Lumene Farmers began to cultivate the Deep Roots, they had adapted to coexist with predators by producing Overgrowths. They ceased growth and retracted tendrils if too many exposed tissue had been eaten. Predators were forced to enter <a href="dormancy.html">Dormancy</a> with their food source gone, and the Deep Roots would again expand. The Farmers learned not to consume too many Deep Roots at once, thereby preventing the Deep Roots from entering unproductive periods.</p>

				<p>Unbeknownst to any but the <a href="faithful.html">Faithful</a>, all Deep Roots in the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a> were connected, and were part of the same ancient organism whose life began in the <a href="age.html#genetic">Genetic Age</a>. The enormous main body of this organism was the <a href="origin.html">Origin</a>, located at the base of the Farmland near the <a href="division.html#underworld">Underworld</a>. Many factors affected the behavior and choices of the Origin, and Farmers of the Faithful creed, such as the <a href="companion.html#groundskeeper">Groundskeeper</a>, learned to read its intentions.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> encounters many Deep Root growths in the Farmlands, including some that are highly highly aggressive and dangerous. At the western end of the Root Fields CT-41 destroys an Overgrowth that has established itself atop one of the <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider</a>'s <a href="altar.html">Altars</a>.</p>
