				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>A Locus was a geographical region wherein <a href="lumene_native.html">Natives</a> of a particular <a href="lineage.html">Lineage</a> gathered and pursued their joint interests. The Native Loci centered around the <a href="womb.html">Womb</a> and the <a href="sea.html">Sea</a>, and together comprised the <a href="realm.html">Realm</a>.</p>

				<p>Members of a Lineage typically built their homes and facilities within the borders of their Locus. The boundaries of the Loci were delineated and updated during <a href="great_council.html">Great Councils</a>, with disputed areas deemed off-limits to parties contesting ownership until a resolution was reached.</p>

				<p>All Native Lineages other than the <a href="lineage.html#explorer">Explorers</a> and the <a href="lineage.html#laborer">Laborers</a> had an officially recognized Locus. Before the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a> the Explorers had no permanent home, and spent much of their time in solitary exploration. The Laborers were initially dispersed throughout the Realm to serve the other Lineages in realizing their diverse pursuits.</p>

				<p>Though the Laborers had no official Locus, they did congregate to certain areas of the Underground near the Farmland, and the Refuge especially. During the final <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html#turn">Turn</a> of the <a href="age.html#hidden">Hidden Age</a>, and under the influence of <a href="presence.html">Presence</a>, the Laborers began constructing and excavating their own Locus beneath the Refuge. At the center of this pseudo-Locus was the <a href="temple.html">Temple</a> of <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a>.</p>

				<p>After the Destruction, the Explorers were constrained by the <a href="lineage.html#ruler">Rulers</a>' mandate to live in the <a href="badlands.html">Badlands</a>. The undesirable region was not a true Locus, but by most practical measures it served as such.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Locus Door</div>

				<p>Within a typical Locus were doors that only responded to commands from members of the corresponding Lineage. These doors were visibly distinct from regular doors, and were typically the same color as the Lineage's tribal color.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> is able to pass through new Locus Doors as it is joined by the empowered <a href="seed.html">Seeds</a> of various Natives.</p>
