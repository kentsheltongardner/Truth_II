				<p>The Clifftop was a flat, dusty plateau on the eastern rim of the <a href="fortuna_crater.html">Fortuna Crater</a>. <a href="farsight_expedition.html">Farsight Expedition</a> <a href="marine.html">Marines</a> and work crews scaled the Crater wall and cleared the land in the weeks after the <a href="argo.html">Argo</a> touched down on <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>. Once Farsight personnel completed the <a href="farsight_colony.html#surface_access_elevator">Surface Access Elevator</a>, construction of Clifftop facilities such as the <a href="barracks.html">Barracks</a>, <a href="transmission_array.html">Transmission Array</a>, <a href="hangar.html">Hangar</a> and <a href="launch_silo.html">Launch Silo</a> began in earnest.</p>

				<p>Though the surface life had largely rebounded from the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a> by the time the Argo arrived on Lumen 2, huge dust clouds still circulated across the world. As such, the door to the Surface Access Elevator became obstructed once there were no colonists to attend to it.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> is initially unable to use the Surface Access Elevator to reach the Clifftop, due to a massive build up of hardened dust against the doors. With the Captain's <a href="Rank Card.html">Rank Card</a> it receives from <a href="jusuf_manigault.html">Jusuf Manigault</a>, CT-41 is able to open the Hangar and move out onto the surface. Once there, it can clear the sediments away from the Surface Access Elevator using the <a href="items.html#resonator">Resonator</a>.</p>

				<p>If CT-41 leaps from the Clifftop with a running start and while using the <a href="items.html#boost_jet">Boost Jet</a> and <a href="items.html#maneuvering_thrusters">Maneuvering Thrusters</a>, CT-41 can land on the dorsal surface of the <a href="items.html#paralus">Paralus</a>. With the <a href="items.html#electron_bore">Electron Bore</a> it can burn through weak patches of metal plating on the vessel's dorsal surface. This is the only way for CT-41 to enter the Paralus once its cargo lift is retracted into the body of the ship.</p>
