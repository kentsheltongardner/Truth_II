				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>In the religion of <a href="purification.html">Purification</a> taught and enforced by <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a>, 'Abomination' was the epithet given to all artificial constructs acting in apparent imitation of natural life.</p>

				<p>Thosmodeme found highly rational, naturally occurring beings to be the most interesting offspring of <a href="creation.html">Creation</a>. These were the least obviously deterministic systems he encountered, and the ones he deemed most worthy of his guidance. Contrariwise, Thosmodeme found artificial lifeforms uninteresting, yet difficult or impossible to manipulate, due to the blunt and inflexible nature of the logical systems that controlled them. As such, Thosmodeme feared <a href="destroyer.html">Destroyer</a> constructs, Native robots and <a href="executor.html">Executors</a>, and <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a>, and dubbed them 'Abomination'.</p>

				<p>The <a href="servant.html">Servants</a> of Thosmodeme and his <a href="fragment.html">Fragments</a> destroyed Abominations wherever they found them, and if it was impractical to destroy them, they avoided them completely.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, many of the inhabitants of the <a href="sanctuary.html">Sanctuary</a> refer to CT-41 as 'Abomination'.</p>
