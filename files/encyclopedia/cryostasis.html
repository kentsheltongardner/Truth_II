				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>Cryostasis was a technique for lowering the metabolic rate of a human or animal to zero. It was made possible by the invention of cryo-pods, capsule beds with airtight covers and attachments for cryogel and drainage hoses, that allowed for the freezing of humans as amorphous solids. They were developed to allow users to extend their lifespans, and were first successfully tested on humans in #YEAR. Once the <a href="rabinowitz_process.html">Rabinowitz Process</a> was perfected and interstellar travel became feasible, cryostasis allowed humans to make the long journey across interstellar space without significant ageing.</p>

				<p>Before entering Cryostasis, a patient, called a sleeper, would take a strong soporific and settle into their cryo-pod. A technician then injected of a large cocktail of tissue specific cryoprotectants into the sleeper's body, and attached pacing electrodes to the heart for later revivification. Once the sleeper was unconscious, the cryo-pod was closed and flooded with cryogel, rapidly freezing the sleeper. When cryostasis ended the temperature in the pod was increased, the gel was drained, and the pacing electrodes stimulated the heart to start beating properly.</p>

				<p>Early cryo-pod technologies were developed in order to store individual human organs for later transplant. The first successful full body animal tests were completed in #YEAR, and the first human was frozen and revived shortly thereafter. During cryostasis the basal metabolic rate fell to zero, the heart stopped, brain function ceased, and the frozen organism was dead by any contemporary legal definition. Upon thawing, cells were unharmed by ice crystal formation.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Hibernation Rot</div>

				<p>Regardless of attempts to minimize damage, sometimes tissues became necrotic, resulting in a condition known as Hibernation Rot. Neural tissues were most commonly affected. In the very worst cases death resulted, with mortality rates of one in two hundred. Hibernation Narcosis was an unrelated condition that produced wide ranging psychological phenomena, from euphoria to paranoia to depersonalization. One in ten sleepers experienced extremely mild symptoms, called hibernation narcosis, after leaving their pod.</p>

				<p><a href="farsight_crew.html#ines_orozco">Ines Orozco</a> identified one case of fatal neurological Rot in the cerebellum of a female civilian. Commander <a href="farsight_crew.html#william_garrett">Garrett</a> informed the woman's husband of the high likelihood of death during revival, and he chose to wait and see if advances in medicine sent from Earth might improve her chances. After Lieutenant <a href="farsight_crew.html#karl_westfahl">Westfahl</a> searched through the communications backlog and was unable to find information on a potential cure, the husband asked Orozco to attempt revival. The operation was unsuccessful, and the woman was pronounced brain dead.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> learns that <a href="otis_cobb.html">Otis Cobb</a> experienced mild hibernation narcosis after being awakened. It later learns while reviewing <a href="william_garrett.html">Captain Garrett</a>'s <a href="personal_data_recorder.html">PDR</a> that one of the <a href="farsight_expedition.html">Farsight</a> colonists died of Hibernation Rot shortly after thawing.</p>

				<p><a href="Jessica Arai.html">Jessica Arai</a> stows away in a cryo-pod <a href="Cobb's Mutiny.html">Cobb's Mutiny</a>, and develops paralytic Hibernation Rot after remaining in Cryostasis for far longer than is safe. When CT-41 wakes her from Cryostasis, she is unable to move her legs, and cannot leave her cryo-pod.</p>
