				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Worshippers were a reclusive family of <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a> that lived near the main vent of the <a href="volcano.html">Volcano</a>. Their progenitor migrated there from the <a href="basin.html">Basin</a> during the <a href="age.html#tribal">Tribal Age</a>, and began to dig out the <a href="deep_ruins.html">Deep Ruins</a> and cultivate what crops and livestock he could find. He and his progeny became numerous, but were all ultimately killed by the <a href="#doom">Doom</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">History</div>

				<p>The first Worshipper was a relative of the early <a href="lineage.html#philosopher">Philosophers</a>, in whom a rare and terminal sickness called the 'Doom' had developed. After learning of his sickness, he sought help from the mystics of his people, to no avail. Disillusioned, he set out into the west to seek his fortune. As he moved into the warm regions nearer the main vent, he began to hear the occasional rumbling movements of <a href="magma_worm.html">Magma Worms</a> in the <a href="division.html#underworld">Underworld</a>, and became convinced that great powers dwelt below him, as indeed they did.</p>

				<p>The Doomed Worshipper settled near the Volcano's base, and began to dig out the tunnels of the home where he would shelter his children. He cultivated the strange plants of the land, and drove away its dangerous creatures. He carved out resonant halls to more easily attain communion with the 'Gods of the Underworld'. When he felt the time was right, he began to bear children.</p>

				<p>These children were also Worshippers of the Gods of the Underworld. They grew more and more adapted to the heat of their home, and pressed ever downward. The Worshippers heard and felt the passing of the immense Magma Worms beneath them, and learned the different calls and habits of the many individuals. The Worshippers' pantheon came to include many different gods, each corresponding to an unseen and colossal Magma Worm or Magma Worm adolescent. The Worms passed by with sufficient regularity that the Worshippers developed a calendar based on their movements.</p>

				<p>The Worshippers constructed their <a href="catacombs.html">Catacombs</a> at extreme profundity, so that their dying kin could inter themselves near the Underworld. Burial was a grueling endeavour: When the Doom began to ravage a Worshipper's <a href="seed.html">Seed</a>, he would make his way down to the Catacombs, to begin carving his own tunnel toward the Underworld. As he was carving his tunnel, he would eventually be overcome by heat and exhaustion, and die in a grave of his own making. This final act of a Worshipper's life was considered essential, and great honor was given to the dead buried in the Catacombs.</p>

				<p>Due to the Doom, the Worshippers dwindled and finally disappeared. While they still lived, what few visitors they received from the east were repulsed by their beliefs, and their sickness. By the time of the <a href="tribal_wars.html">Tribal Wars</a>, the Deep Ruins were uninhabited, forgotten, and cut off from the rest of the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> enters the Worshippers' Catacombs, and with the <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider</a>'s help it glimpses the fragmentary thoughts of the Doomed Worshippers who interred themselves there.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Doom</div>

				<p>The Doom was a neuro-degenerative genetic disease inherited and suffered by the Worshippers and several other early <a href="lineage.html#philosopher">Philosophers</a>. The illness ran its course over many generations, becoming more deadly each time it was passed from parent to child. Contracting the Doom was the greatest fear of most <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a>, and wishing the Doom upon another Native was the Kindred's cruelest curse.</p>

				<p>The Doom developed in the <a href="seed.html">Seeds</a> of several <a href="lineage.html#philosopher">Philosophers</a> throughout the <a href="age.html">Ages</a>, invariably killing the descendents of all those carried it. When first Worshipper moved west of the <a href="basin.html">Basin</a> in the <a href="age.html#emergent">Emergent Age</a>, he carried the Doom with him.</p>

				<p>At a certain age, those afflicted by the Doom began to experience traumatic dissociative episodes. They became violent and irrational, and were dangerous to themselves and others. If the disease was allowed to progress, sufferers had to be restrained or sedated with poisons taken from local animals. In the final stage of the disease, as pain and mental confusion grew unbearable, those afflicted often attempted to tear out their own Seeds.</p>

				<p>Although the Worshippers grew numerous, even prosperous, in the <a href="lower_ruins.html">Lower Ruins</a>, the Doom was always with them. They prayed to the <a href="magma_worm.html">Gods of the Underworld</a> to save them and their children, but to no avail. As they began to feel the Doom affect them they burrowed toward the Underworld, each Worshipper boring out his own hall in the <a href="catacombs.html">Catacombs</a> with the hope that his children might be spared his fate.</p>

				<p>However, with every passing generation the lifespan of the Worshippers shortened as the Doom came to them more and more quickly. Once the onset of the Doom came before sexual maturity, no more offspring could be produced, and the society of the Worshippers ended.</p>
