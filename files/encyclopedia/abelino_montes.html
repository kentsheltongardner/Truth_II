				<p>Recruit Abelino Montes was a member of the <a href="farsight_expedition.html">Farsight Expedition</a>'s Work Crew Four. Montes was the first member of the Expedition killed by members of the <a href="labor_society.html">Labor Society</a>.</p>

				<p>Originally from Argentina, Montes worked for several African mining operations while in his twenties. Unattached to Earth at age 31, he applied for an extra-solar mining position posted by the <a href="united_colonial_administration.html">United Colonial Administration</a>'s recruitment agency, and made it through the Administration's rigorous selective process due to his work qualifications, excellent physical health, and optimal intelligence and psychological evaluation results.<p>
				
				<p>Throughout the lengthy application and interview process, Montes, like all other Recruits and civilians, received very few details on the Farsight Expedition's destination and mission. Once he was locked into the <a href="expeditionary_contract.html">Expeditionary Contract</a>, he was isolated and comms locked. Administration representatives then provided more information about the mission, such as the possibility of making contact with extraterrestrial life on <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>.</p>

				<p>After arriving on Lumen 2, Montes spent the majority of his working hours in the <a href="mine.html">Mine</a>, and was considered by his peers and superiors to be an efficient and dedicated worker. After several months of work, Royce Canosa, one of <a href="otis_cobb.html">Otis Cobb's</a> foremen, approached Montes and invited him to join a fraternity called the 'Labor Society'. Though he was interested in joining, Montes was unsure about the strict legality of becoming a <a href="laborer_human.html">Laborer</a>, and consulted Lieutenant Commander <a href="kiaan_sood.html">Kiaan Sood</a>.</p>
				
				<p>Sood advised Montes to join the group, and to discretely apprise him of its teachings and activities. At the next opportunity, Montes told his recruiting foreman that he wished to join the society, and was told that he would be initiated at his first assembly. When Montes asked the foreman when and where the assembly would be held, the foreman declined to answer.</p>
				
				<p>Three weeks later, two Laborers came to Montes at the start of his shift, and told him that it was time for assembly, and for his initiation. Montes was escorted to an undocumented chamber in the Mine, and brought to the front of a group of silent Laborers. During the assembly Cobb interrogated Montes in front of the initiated Laborers.</p>
				
				<p>The <a href="fragment.html">Fragment</a> that Cobb carried quickly discerned that Montes intended to inform Sood of the Society's practices and doctrines. Cobb ordered several Laborers to seize Montes, and ordered others to grab stones from the cavern floor. Outnumbered and overpowered, Montes was clubbed to death, and buried at the base of the Mine's <a href="lower_levels.html">Lower Levels</a>.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> digs through several meters of loose soil to find Montes' body, his Recruit's <a href="rank_card.html">Rank Card</a>, and his <a href="personal_data_recorder.html">PDR</a> in the Lower Levels of the Mine. With Montes' Rank Card CT-41 is able to pass through the <a href="guardhouse.html">Guardhouse</a>, and enter the <a href="ironworks.html">Ironworks</a> and the <a href="machine_shop.html">Machine Shop</a>.</p>
