				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Artificial Womb was a device capable of protecting, feeding and nurturing a developing human fetus. The first successful Artificial Womb was perfected in #YEAR, and allowed children to be born without having to be carried by a mother. Use of Artificial Wombs greatly improved average fetal health, and circumvented almost all of the complications of childbirth. Within a few decades of the invention of the Artificial Womb natural births were frowned upon in most developed states as irresponsible.</p>

				<p>By the time of the <a href="paralus.html">Paralus</a>' arrival on <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>, all human children on Earth and her colonies were incubated in Artificial Wombs. The use of Artificial Wombs made physical motherhood superfluous, and without the physical constraints placed on them by a mother's body, fetuses were able to grow much larger in Artificial Wombs than they would in a mother's uterus. This fact, coupled with the widespread genetic designing of children, led to the near disappearance of the XX chromosome female. Vestigial reproductive characteristics and drives were incredibly rare among <a href="enhanced_humans.html">Enhanced Humans</a>, who were almost all phenotypically male.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> passes through the Paralus' <a href="paralus.html#birthing_center">Birthing Center</a>, and notices several Artificial Wombs. Through their glass viewports CT-41 is able to see the developing fetuses inside them, all lacking distinguishing sexual characteristics.
