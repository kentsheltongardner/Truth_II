				<p>The Dark Room was a chamber west of the <a href="chemical_disposal_area.html">Chemical Disposal Area</a>, where a <a href="proto_native.html">Proto-Native</a> predecessor of the <a href="common_ancestor.html">Common Ancestor</a> lived during the <a href="pre_tribal_extinction.html">Pre-Tribal Extinction</a>. It was the setting of the <a href="shame.html">Shame</a>, a painful recollection in the <a href="chain_of_memory.html">Chain of Memory</a> of most <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a>.</p>

				<p>After a coronal mass ejection impacted <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a> at the end of the <a href="age.html#emergent">Emergent Age</a>, many surface species quickly went extinct. The effects of the extinction were felt more gradually in the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>. The balance of life was dirupted, food became scarce, and many creatures died or went into <a href="dormancy.html">Dormancy</a>. The Dark Room was a well hidden chamber in which a Proto-Native took refuge, occasionally emerging to hunt and scavenge in darkness.</p>

				<p>One of the <a href="old_god.html">Old Gods</a> eventually learned of the Proto-Native, and saw it return to the Dark Room. It entered the chamber, and found the Proto-Native and its young. The Old God was starving, and the Proto-Native had no offering for it. The Old God was weakened, and might not have been willing to risk injury in a fight against an adult Proto-Native. However, in the Dark Room, the Proto-Native chose to dims its lights and flee, leaving the Old God to feast on its children. The Proto-Native never returned to the Dark Room, since the Old God knew its location.</p>
				
				<p>In later ages, memories of the Dark Room caused Natives of the <a href="lineage.html#high_lineage">High Lineages</a> great discomfort. The chamber was not visited, and was never claimed or developed by any Lineage.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> is able to open the passage to the Dark Room after it finds the <a href="../items.html#impact_cannon">Impact Cannon</a>. Inside the Dark Room the <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider</a> grants CT-41 a <a href="../visions.html#dark_room">Vision</a> of the Shame.</p>
