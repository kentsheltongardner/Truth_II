				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>CICI was the name given by Ensign <a href="nicholas_ormeil.html">Nicholas Ormeil</a> to the <a href="argo.html">Argo</a>'s central computer. CICI was in charge of coordinating all computer subsystems, processing queries, and communicating results to <a href="farsight_expedition.html">Farsight Expedition</a> personnel. During the construction of the <a href="farsight_colony.html">Farsight Colony</a>, CICI was integrated with many Colony systems, including its power grid.</p>

				<p>Immediately after <a href="cobbs_mutiny.html">Cobb's Mutiny</a>, <a href="otis_cobb.html">Cobb</a> himself cleared CICI's memory banks, to prevent other parties from discovering the fate of the colonists. During the period of time between the Mutiny and the emergency summons that awakened <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> from sleep mode, CICI maintained an <a href="event_logs.html">Event Log</a> of all major happenings in the Colony.</p>
				
				<div class="entry-section-title">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, CICI helps to direct <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a>, offers analyses of its acquisitions, and alerts CT-41 when she receives communications from Earth.</p>

				<p>When the <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider</a> damages the <a href="farsight_colony.html#communications_bunker">Communications Bunker</a> after sending his message to Earth, CICI notifies CT-41, who returns to the Colony to investigate. Per intruder protocol, CICI places the Colony in lockdown, and CT-41 must find a novel way into the Colony.</p>
