				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Frontier was an expansive and relatively untamed region of the Lumene <a href="underground.html">Underground</a> that dominated the upper eastern quadrant of the <a href="realm.html">Realm</a>. It was bounded to the east by the <a href="#hunting_grounds">Hunting Grounds</a> and the <a href="wild.html">Wild</a>, and extended upward nearly to the surface of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>. To the west were the impassable <a href="nucleus.html#razor_caverns">Razor Caverns</a>, braved only by the nimblest, or most foolhardy, <a href="lineage.html#explorer">Explorers</a>. Below the Frontier was <a href="no_mans_land.html">No Man's Land</a>, a battle-scarred and uninhabited region left undisturbed after the <a href="tribal_wars.html">Tribal Wars</a>.</p>

				<p>During the first <a href="great_council.html">Great Council</a>, the <a href="lineage.html#ruler">Rulers</a> offered the Frontier to the <a href="lineage.html#adventurer">Adventurers</a>, to be their <a href="locus.html">Locus</a> forever within the newly created Realm. The <a href="lineage.html#warrior">Warriors</a> accepted the offer, and began to rebuild their homeland. The Explorers, however, elected to have no Locus. They preferred to have only temporary lodgings within the Realm, places to rest between excursions into the unknown.</p>

				<p>After the <a href="ct_41.html">Destruction and the Warriors' <a href="destruction.html#sacrifice">Sacrifice</a>, the Frontier was <a href="sanctification.html">Sanctified</a>, and no <a href="lumene_native.html">Natives</a> were permitted to take up permanent residence there. Several <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html#turn">Turns</a> after the <a href="lineage.html#laborer">Laborers</a> were admitted into the <a href="kindred.html">Kindred</a>, they expressed interest in gathering as a Lineage in the Frontier. The Rulers consistently rejected these petitions on practical and sentimental grounds, leading to resentment against them among the Laborers.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> falls into the <a href="farsight_colony.html#fuel_dump">Fuel Dump</a>, and passes through the <a href="menagerie.html">Menagerie</a> and Hunting Grounds at the eastern edge of the Frontier. These are CT-41's first excursions into the ancient Realm of the Kindred. Later, when the <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider</a> damages the <a href="farsight_colony.html#communications_bunker">Communications Bunker</a>, CT-41 is able to bypass the <a href="farsight_colony.html">Farsight Colony</a>'s automatic security lock-down by navigating through new areas of the Frontier, and entering the Colony via its <a href="farsight_colony.html#liquid_waste_tank">Liquid Waste Tanks</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Areas</div>
				<a id="arena"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Arena</div>

				<p>The Arena was a large open cavern in the <a href="lineage.html#warrior">Warriors'</a> <a href="locus.html">Locus</a> where Warriors tested themselves in battle against each other, monsters captured from the <a href="wild.html">Wild</a>, and the <a href="challenger.html">Challenger</a>.</p>

				<p>The last battle of the <a href="tribal_wars.html">Tribal Wars</a> was fought in the Arena. During this battle, the Warriors and <a href="lineage.html#explorer">Explorers</a> fought desperately and inflicted greivous losses on the coalition army. However, they were heavily outnumbered and were slowly driven back. The Warriors prepared to die defending their <a href="treasury.html">Treasury</a>, while the Explorers moved upward toward their homeland.</p>

				<p>As it was the Warriors' custom to leave the bodies of their dead where they fell, the remains of many Warriors were left on the Arena floor. To these were added the bodies of Warriors who later died in ritual combat in the Arena. After the <a href="destruction.html#sacrifice">Sacrifice</a>, the <a href="lineage.html#ruler">Rulers</a> gathered the <a href="seed.html">Seeds</a> of many Warriors from the Arena, to immortalize them within <a href="executor.html">Executors</a>.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a>'s second battle against the Challenger takes place in the Arena.</p>

				<a id="holding_cells"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Holding Cells</div>

				<p>.</p>

				<a id="hunting_grounds"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Hunting Grounds</div>

				<p>The Hunting Grounds were a region, between the <a href="realm.html">Realm</a> and the <a href="wild.html">Wild</a>, where <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> <a href="lineage.html#warrior.html">Warriors</a> tracked and killed their prey. Great honor was conferred upon Warriors able to capture or slay the large and dangerous monsters found in the Hunting Grounds. Many <a href="beast.html">Beasts</a> from the Wild also hunted the same caverns, and frequently came into conflict with Warriors.</p>

				<p>During the Tribal Wars, a band of Warriors and Explorers became trapped in a <a href="cave_in.html">Cave-in</a> while searching for a secret passage into the <a href="farmlands.html">Farmlands</a>. Of all the lifeforms confined by the Cave-in, only the <a href="companion.html#tribesman">Tribesman</a> remained alive after starvation, combat and asphyxiation claimed all others.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> may enter the Hunting Grounds, where the wealth of aggressive enemy creatures allows it to quickly optimize its lasers. In the Hunting Grounds CT-41 finds the buried remains of a Lumene Warrior locked in combat with a Beast, and takes its <a href="../items.html#warriors_shroud">Warrior's Shroud</a>.</p>

				<a id="menagerie"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Menagerie</div>

				<p>The Menagerie was a region of the Frontier where <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> <a href="lineage.html#warrior.html">Warriors</a> bred and housed hunting companions, and caged exotic creatures they captured in the <a href="wild.html">Wild</a>. Hunters and Native Pets were both initially bred by Warriors in the Menagerie's enclosures.</p>

				<p>In the <a href="age.html#tribal">Tribal Age</a>, and even well into the <a href="age.html#enlightened">Enlightened Age</a>, many of the dangerous specimens Warriors bred in the Menagerie were later taken to the <a href="arena.html">Arena</a>, where Warriors honed their skills by killing them in ritual combat. The practice of slaying <a href="beast.html">Beasts</a> and other lifeforms was eventually supplanted by combat against the <a href="challenger.html">Challenger</a>.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> passes through the Menagerie as it wends its way downward from the <a href="farsight_colony.html#fuel_dump">Fuel Dump</a>.</p>

				<a id="nursery"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Nursery</div>

				<p>The Nursery was a cavern, connected to but far beneath the <a href="upper_ruins.html">Upper Ruins</a>, where <a href="lineage.html#explorer">Explorers</a> of the <a href="age.html#tribal">Tribal Age</a> birthed and nurtured their children while they were still vulnerable to the elements and predation. The Nursery was necessarily deeper in the crust of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a> than the Upper Ruins, to protect young Explorers from the heat and cold experienced in shallower regions.</p>

				<p>As the first <a href="lineage.html#adventurer.html">Adventurers</a> moved away from the <a href="womb.html">Womb</a> and upward toward the surface of Lumen 2, it became increasingly dangerous and difficult to return to the pools of the Womb to bear and protect their children. While the <a href="lineage.html#warrior">Warriors</a> birthed their children in natural caverns, Explorers designed and built a series of aqueducts that carried water to a chamber of their design. There expectant parents could swim in the waters, and children could begin their physical development in safety.</p>

				<p>Explorers carved images of Natives and other creatures into the walls of the Nursery, and adorned the walls with <a href="glowstone.html">Glowstone</a>. They also formed numerous pillars and perches that flowed with the stone of the caverns. Young Explorers eagerly practiced using their lights to illuminate the Glowstone, and learned to move their new limbs as they climbed on the faux obstacles placed before them by their parents.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, the #COMPANION grants <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> a vision as it enters the Nursery.</p>

				<a id="upper_ruins"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Upper Ruins</div>

				<p>The Upper Ruins were a region of the eastern <a href="shallows.html">Shallows</a>, where a primitive tribe of daring <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a> migrated early in the <a href="age.html#tribal">Tribal Age</a>. Human work crews later discovered the Upper Ruins while boring out a tunnel at the base of the <a href="farsight_colony.html#secure_wing">Secure Wing</a> of the <a href="farsight_colony.html">Farsight Colony</a>. The <a href="farsight_expedition.html">Expedition</a>'s archaeology team quickly took over the <a href="farsight_colony.html#excavation">Excavation</a>, and began to remove material from the newly discovered caverns.</p>

				<p>The Upper Ruins were filled with heavy run-off sediments from the surface, which human researchers meticulously cleared away as they unearthed Native artifacts and structures. Only the top-eastern quadrant of the site was excavated by the archaeology team before <a href="cobbs_mutiny.html">Cobb's Mutiny</a> ended all human activity in the Colony.</p>

				<p>Long before the counting of <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html#turn">Turns</a>, a small tribe of Lumene Natives, later called <a href="lineage.html#explorer.html">Explorers</a>, branched off from the <a href="lineage.html#adventurer.html">Adventurer's</a> <a href="lineage.html">Lineage</a> and settled near the surface of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>, beneath the eastern edge of the <a href="fortuna_crater.html">Fortuna Crater</a>. These Natives learned to hunt in the <a href="emptiness.html">Emptiness</a> during the dawn and dusk, when the rains and the <a href="migration.html">Migrations</a> came. They were ambush hunters, emerging from tunnels near the eastern wall of the crater and taking surface creatures by surprise. For many Turns the small tribe expanded their surface hunts, storing food from their hunts in hidden places, in preparation for times of famine during the Lumene day and night.</p>

				<p>Several Turns before the <a href="tribal_wars.html">Tribal Wars</a> began, bands of huge, brutish Natives began to attack the isolated Explorers, surging up from below and plundering their stores of food. After many such raids the tribe was overwhelmed, and its members began to die of hunger. Defeated, the tribe met with their enemies from below, bringing the last of their hunted game as a peace offering.</p>

				<p>During their meeting with the attackers, the chief Explorers proposed an alliance. They would serve the more powerful <a href="lineage.html#warrior">Warriors</a> as scouts, seeking out elusive game, and the stores of food hoarded by the numerous but peaceful Native populations nearer the <a href="womb.html">Womb</a>. Soon afterward Explorers began to lead raiding parties to the <a href="farmlands.html#upper_root_fields">Upper Root Fields</a> began, and the stage was set for the Tribal Wars. During the Wars the Explorers' caverns were abandoned, and began to fall into disrepair.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> passes through the dark and dusty Upper Ruins as it attempts to find a way to break into the Farsight Colony while it is in lock-down</p>

				<a id="treasury"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Treasury</div>
				
				<p>The Treasury comprised a series of chambers, near the top of the <a href="lineage.html#warrior">Warriors</a>' ancestral <a href="locus.html">Locus</a>, where in the <a href="age.html#tribal">Tribal Age</a> they hoarded food, precious materials, hunting trophies, prizes taken in war, ancestral totems and ritual objects.</p>

				<p>After the <a href="tribal_wars.html">Tribal Wars</a> and the <a href="unification.html">Unification</a>, new chambers were added to the Treasury, wherein were stored items of historical or economic significance to the <a href="kindred.html">Kindred</a>. The Warriors were charged by the <a href="lineage.html#ruler">Rulers</a> with protecting the Treasury, and it was considered an honor to stand guard there. From the late <a href="age.html#planetary">Planetary Age</a> onward, entrance was only granted to those Warriors who successfully withstood the <a href="challenger.html">Challenger</a>.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> withstands or destroys the Challenger, and enters the Treasury. It passes through several chambers lined with historical artifacts before it finds the #ITEM. It is then able to move upward toward the unexcavated portions of <a href="#upper_ruins">Upper Ruins</a>.
