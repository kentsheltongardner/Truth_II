				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Desolation was a region in the crust of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>, several meters beneath the <a href="fortuna_crater.html">Fortuna Crater</a> and east of the <a href="caverns.html">Caverns</a>. It contained the remnants of <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Native</a> structures that were razed by <a href="destroyer.html">Destroyer</a> <a href="gateway.html">Gateways</a> during the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a>. The upper portions of the Desolation contained ruins melted and mangled almost beyond recognition, but the lower chambers were increasingly well preserved, housing nearly intact Native facilities and remains.</p>

				<p>Native <a href="lineage.html#explorer">Explorers</a> first began constructing permanent facilities on the surface of Lumen 2 east of the <a href="openings.html">Openings</a> they bored. The first major Native population center was built up several kilometers east of the Fortuna Crater. These establishments and all others across the Lumene surface were destroyed during the Destruction.</p>

				<p>By the time the <a href="argo.html">Argo</a> landed on Lumen 2, dust blasted into the atmosphere during the Destruction had settled into a thick sedimentary layer across the floor of the Fortuna Crater, and buried the few protruding bones of Native structure that remained there. This sedimentation was visible at the entrance to the Caverns and the <a href="mine.html">Mine</a>, as well as in the Desolation. Due to the sedimentation, Captain <a href="william_garret.html">Garrett</a> focused much of the <a href="farsight_expedition.html">Farsight Expedition</a>'s scientific manpower toward study of the more accessible city and launch complex to the east, rather than the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>.</p>
				
				<div class="entry-section-title">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> enters the Desolation after defeating the <a href="beast.html">Beast</a> and digging its way out of the Caverns. In the Desolation CT-41 uncovers the first <a href="altar.html">Altar</a> of its journey, and finds the <a href="../items.html#energy_shield">Energy Shield</a> on the body of crushed Native.</p>
