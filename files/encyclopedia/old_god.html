				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Old Gods were the most intelligent of the <a href="ancient.html">Ancients</a>, and were the apex predators of the Lumene <a href="underground.html">Underground</a> from the late <a href="age.html#aquatic">Aquatic Age</a> until the <a href="pre_tribal_extinction.html">Pre-Tribal Extinction</a>. These monstrous creatures bored enormous tunnels through the crust while searching for prey. These tunnels were used by many other creatures of the Underground, including <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a>, and many were still traveled well into the later <a href="age.html">Ages</a> of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>.</p>

				<p>When an enormous coronal mass ejection that ended the <a href="age.html#emergent">Emergent Age</a> caused nearly all life on the surface of Lumen 2 to go extinct, the Old Gods entered <a href="dormancy.html">Dormancy</a>, waiting for the return of their prey. In the thousands of <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html#turn">Turns</a> that followed, Lumene Natives took their place atop the predatory hierarchy of the Underground.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Hunting</div>

				<p>The Old Gods developed a symbiotic relationship with <a href="proto_native.html">Proto-Natives</a>, long before the advent of the <a href="common_ancestor.html">Common Ancestor</a> and the <a href="native_mind.html#luminary">Luminary</a>. When a Proto-Native spotted a large prey animal that it could not overpower, it would let out howls that echoed through the Underground. If one of the Old Gods heard the Native's howls, it would follow them toward its prey. The Native would pursue its frightened and desperate quarry, maintaining distance and howling until the Old God rushed in, slaying the beast and consuming its flesh.</p>

				<p>If it was pleased by the meal, and the Native reverenced it, the Old God would leave much of the carcass for the Native to scavenge. However, if an Old God encountered a Native without an offering, it did not hesitate to eat the Native or its offspring.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Legacy</div>

				<p>A deep feeling of awe, terror and reverence developed in the mind of the <a href="native_mind.html#simpleton">Simpleton</a> toward the Old Gods, a feeling which persisted as long as the <a href="chain_of_memory.html">Chain of Memory</a>. <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a>, at the start of the <a href="subjugation.html">Subjugation</a>, entered the minds of many <a href="lineage.html#laborer">Laborers</a> as an Old God, and was thus able to command their obedience.</p>

				<p>Lumene Natives of the <a href="lineage.html#high_lineage">High Lineages</a> bore a dark memory of their final encounter with an Old God, which they called the '<a href="shame.html">Shame</a>'.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Old Gods</div>
