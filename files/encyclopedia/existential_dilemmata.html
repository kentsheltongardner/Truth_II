				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Existential Dilemmata were two theorems, proved by the <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider</a>, regarding the absolute limits to what can be known about reality. The Dilemmata, originally applied to logical systems, also held true for physical systems such as <a href="creation.html">Creation</a> and the <a href="real.html">Real</a>.</p>
				
				<p>After proving the Dilemmata, the Outsider knew that if the universe were infinite, it could never be fully described or undertsood, and if it were finite, it could not be described from within. Guessing that the universe was a finite region within a greater reality, the Outsider constructed his <a href="altar.html">Altars</a>, which he hoped would allow him to peer into a higher reality, of which the universe is but a subset.</p>

				<p>The complete proofs of the Dilemmata cannot be included here due to size constraints, and instead we present the conclusions only. There was debate among the <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a> as to whether the Dilematta only held true for causal systems, such as exist within a temporal universe.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Infinite Dilemma</div>

				<p>"Any statement of finite length, which attempts to fully describe a system containing infinite elements, will be incomplete or give rise to contradiction. Therefore, such a system cannot have a finite description."</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Finite Dilemma</div>

				<p>"No system containing finite elements can exist necessarily, or be the cause of its own existence. Therefore, such a system cannot be fully described in terms of itself."</p>
