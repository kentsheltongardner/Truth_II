				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>A Lineage was a named family of <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a>, adapted to possess distinguishable physical, intellectual and behavioral traits. In Lumene taxonomy, each Lineage could be traced back to a <a href="progenitor.html">Progenitor</a>, the first acknowledged member and examplar of that Lineage.</p>

				<p>From the beginning of the <a href="age.html#tribal">Tribal Age</a> until the <a href="slaughter.html">Slaughter</a>, Native society in the <a href="realm.html">Realm</a> consisted of the competetive and cooperative interactions of various Native Lineages. These Lineages all descended from the same primordial organism, and individuals of each were Lineage similar enough to each other to allow mutual communication.</p>

				<p>The first three Lineages known to distinguish themselves were the <a href="#adventurer">Adventurers</a>, the <a href="#nurturer">Nurturers</a>, and the <a href="#philosopher">Philosophers</a>. These Lineages were later called the <a href="#ancestral_lineage">Ancestral Lineages</a>. During the Tribal Age, each Ancestral Lineages split into two. These were called the <a href="#high_lineage">High Lineages</a>.</p>

				<p>The formal classifications and geneologies of the High Lineages were codified in the inaugural <a href="great_council.html">Great Council</a> after the <a href="tribal_wars.html">Tribal Wars</a>. From the Adventurers had come the <a href="#explorer">Explorers</a> and <a href="#warrior.html">Warriors</a>, from the Nurturers the <a href="#farmer">Farmers</a> and <a href="#healer">Healers</a>, and from the Philosophers the <a href="#ruler">Rulers</a> and <a href="#engineer">Engineers</a>. These Lineages considered themselves to all be members of a race called the <a href="kindred.html">Kindred</a>. The Lineage of the <a href="#laborer">Laborer</a> joined the Kindred much later, during the <a href="age.html#hidden">Hidden Age</a>.</p>

				<p>All Lineages except that of the Laborer possessed the advanced, rational mind of the <a href="lumene_minds.html#luminary">Luminary</a>. The Laborer was a lower Native that only housed the mind of the <a href="lumene_minds.html#simpleton">Simpleton</a>. It was uplifted into Native society to serve and learn, and was not counted among the High Lineages</a>. The Philosophers, and later the Engineers and Rulers, were uniquely aware of a higher consciousness, called the <a href="lumene_minds.html#transcendence">Transcendence</a>.

				<p>All Lineages except the Explorers and the Laborers had a <a href="locus.html">Locus</a> near the <a href="womb.html">Womb</a> where they congregated, preserving and perfecting their identities. The Explorers did not desire a Locus, and instead spent their lives venturing into the unknown, returning from their solitary journeys bearing secret knowledge. The Laborers, after being introduced into Lumene society, dwelt dispersed throughout the Realm, learning from and serving the High Lineages.</p>

				<p>After the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a>, when the <a href="remnant.html">Remnant</a> had gathered from the across the surface of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a> into the Womb, the Rulers passed two judgments upon Lineages. First, the extinct Warriors were honored for their <a href="destruction.html#sacrifice">Sacrifice</a>. Their Locus was <a href="sanctification.html">Sanctified</a>, and no other Lineage was permitted to take residence in their Locus. Second, the Explorers were <a href="destruction.html#punishment">punished</a>, and confined to the drier, less desirable <a href="badlands.html">Badlands</a> near the western surface. They were tasked with handling the waste of the Remnant, and Laborers were never under any obligation to serve them.</p>

			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Ancestral Lineages</div>

				<p>As <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a> began to form groups and cooperate with each other to acheive collective aims, certain individuals naturally began to specialize. Over time successful and exemplary Native strains evolved into observably distinct Lineages. The first three Lineages to emerge were the <a href="#adventurer">Adventurers</a>, the <a href="#nurturer">Nurturers</a>, and the <a href="#philosopher">Philosophers</a>. Later each Anscestral Lineage split into two, producing the six <a href="#high_lineage">High Lineages</a>.</p>

				<a id="adventurer"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Adventurer</div>
				<p>The Adventurers, also called Doers, tended to be more solitary and aggressive than Natives of other Lineages, and spent their time tracking, trapping or fighting prey. Long before other Lineages began moving upward through the crust, the Adventurers had moved away from the <a href="womb.html">Womb</a>, toward the <a href="hunting_grounds.html">Hunting Grounds</a> and even the surface of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>. Before the <a href="unification.html">Unification</a>, the Adventurers' speech patterns were less nuanced and more abrupt than those of the other Lineages. During the <a href="tribal_wars.html">Tribal Wars</a>, the Adventurers fought against a coalition of the Nurturers and Philosophers.</p>

				<a id="nurturer"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Nurturer</div>
				<p>During the <a href="age.html#tribal">Tribal Age</a>, the Nurturers, also called Feelers, did not stray far from the warmth of the <a href="magma_chamber.html">Magma Chambers</a>. They cultivated the crops and creatures of those biomes, amassing great flocks and tending wide fields. The Nurturers tended to live significantly longer than Natives of the other Lineages, leading to discrepancies in timekeeping. They were also the most numerous ancestral Lineage, having the most reliable access to food. During the Tribal Wars, certain Nurturers distinguished themselves sufficiently in the medical treament of their brethren to be named <a href="#healer">Healers</a> at the first <a href="great_council.html">Great Council</a>.</p>

				<a id="philosopher"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Philosopher</div>
				<p>The Philosophers, also called Thinkers, dwelt in caves beneath and to the west of the Womb. They were skilled craftsmen and miners, and developed theories of math and economics as they engineered structural solutions and traded with the Nurturers. Unlike the other Ancestral Lineages, they became aware of an aloof mind called the <a href="lumene_minds.html#transcendence">Transcendence</a>, and were able to enter a trancelike state of pure thought while their lower minds handled simple, menial tasks. During the War of the Lineage, the Philosophers came to the aid of the Nurturers, and eventually took command of the war effort. It was their leadership and practical sciences that eventually turned the tide against the Adventurers.</p>

			</div>

			<a id="high_lineage"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">High Lineages</div>

				<p>The High Lineages were the six distinct populations or tribes of <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a> united and named during the <a href="unification.html">Unification</a>. All modern Lumene Natives save the <a href="#laborer">Laborers</a> were born into one of the High Lineages.</p>

				<a id="engineer"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Engineer</div>

				<p>The Engineers were a <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Native</a> <a href="#high_lineage">High Lineage</a> driven by a powerful urge to understand and exploit the fundamental workings of the universe. In their Locus the Engineers investigated physcial systems and developed numerous technologies. Like the <a href="#ruler">Rulers</a>, the Engineers were aware of the mind of the <a href="lumene_minds.html#transcendence">Transcendence</a>, and allowed their bodies to operate autonomously for long stretches while they lived in abstraction.</p>

				<p>The Engineers branched from their <a href="#ancestral_lineage">Ancestral Lineage</a> of the <a href="#philosopher">Philosophers</a> long before the <a href="tribal_wars.html">Tribal Wars</a>, and generally concerned themselves with the 'is' and 'how' questions of reality, rather than the 'oughts' that fascinated the Rulers. The Engineers distinguished themselves during the Tribal Wars by designing the weapons, armor and tools that eventually gave the coalition of <a href="#nurturer">Nurturers</a> and Philosophers the advantage against the more aggressive <a href="#adventurer">Adventurers</a>.</p>

				<p>After the War, the Engineers were given the caverns west of the <a href="magma_chamber.html">Magma Chambers</a> as their <a href="locus.html">Locus</a>. As their technology improved, Engineers constructed facilities such as the <a href="mineral_separation_plant.html">Mineral Separation Plant</a>, the <a href="geothermal_power_station.html">Geothermal Power Station</a>, the <a href="factory.html">Factory</a>, and the <a href="accelerator.html">Accelerator</a>.</p>

				<p>Near the end of the <a href="age.html#stellar">Stellar Age</a>, Engineers helped the <a href="#explorer">Explorers</a> to design <a href="probe.html">Probes</a>, interstellar spacecraft capable of transmitting stellar and planetary data back to <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>. Thousands of these Probes were sent to <a href="lumen.html">Lumen</a>'s stellar neighbors, and were noticed by <a href="destroyer.html">Destroyers</a> in interstellar space. Although several Engineers were involved in the development of the Probes, their Lineage was not punished like the Explorers' after the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a>, as they had been unaware of the Rulers' objections.</p>

				<p>During the <a href="age.html#hidden">Hidden Age</a>, the Rulers tasked the Engineers with developing technologies to combat the Destroyers, should they return. The Engineers developed and stockpiled advanced defenses and weaponry in the <a href="hearth.html#tech_lab">Tech Lab</a>, and accepted the help of a young Explorer when he proved himself to be an insightful and dedicated physicist.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> finds and is accompanied by the <a href="seed.html">Seed</a> of a Engineer called the <a href="companions.html#stargazer">Stargazer</a>.</p>

				<a id="explorer"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Explorer</div>

				<p>The Explorers were a Native Lineage with an intense and innate desire to venture into the unknown and discover its secrets. Theirs was a high risk, high reward survival strategy. By far the least numerous of the Native Lineages, the Explorers' role in Lumene society was to identify threats to the <a href="kindred.html">Kindred</a>, locate resources outside the <a href="realm.html">Realm</a>, and prepare new territories for settlement. After the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a> the Explorers were <a href="destruction.html#punishment">punished</a>, and confined to the <a href="badlands.html">Badlands</a>, where they recycled or disposed of the <a href="remnant.html">Remnant</a>'s trash.</p>

				<p>The Explorers branched off from the <a href="ancestral_lineage">Ancestral Lineage</a> of the <a href="#adventurer">Adventurer</a> long before any cohesive Native society was established. The Explorers were the only High Lineage not to have a <a href="locus.html">Locus</a>. They spent most of their lives in the uninhabited areas of the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>, returning to the Realm occasionally to inform the other Lineages of their findings. Explorers were comfortable making temporary shelters in almost any region of the Underground, and went out into the unknown well equipped to deal with its hazards.</p>

				<p>Though all Native Lineages benefitted from the knowledge the Explorers gained during their wanderings, the Explorers felt a special kinship with the <a href="#engineer">Engineers</a> and <a href="#warrior">Warriors</a>, and worked with them often. The Explorers collected data for the Engineers, while the Engineers designed equipment to aid the Explorers in their journeys. When Explorers identified threats such as <a href="beast.html">Beasts</a> and <a href="rogue.html">Rogues</a> in the Wild, they led Warriors to confront them.</p>

				<p>The Explorers were the first Natives to brave the surface of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>, which they called the <a href="emptiness.html">Emptiness</a>. Most Natives had an intense fear of the Emptiness, but this fear was much less keenly felt by the Explorers, and what fear they did feel was difficult to distinguish from excitement. At the end of the <a href="age.html#enlightened">Enlightened Age</a>, Explorers bored and reinforced the <a href="openings.html">Openings</a>, built artificial caves on the surface of Lumen 2, and coaxed the remaining Lineages out of the Underground. Over the course of many <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html#turn">Turns</a>, networks of small settlments spread across the planet.</p>

				<p>Still the Explorers urged the Kindred upward. With the help of the Engineers, and owing to the relatively low gravity of Lumen 2, the Explorers took to space quickly. They first established a base on their moon, <a href="nox.html">Nox</a>, and then began colonizing <a href="lumen_3.html">Lumen 3</a> and <a href="lumen_4.html">Lumen 4</a>, ushering the Kindred into the <a href="age.html#stellar">Stellar Age</a>.</p>

				<p>Ever eager to increase their knowledge of the unknown, the Explorers again collaborated with the Engineers to create thousands of small but incredibly fast interstellar <a href="probe.html">Probes</a>, to discover what lay beyond the Lumen system. In spite of the Rulers' objections, the Explorers launched Probes to thousands of proximal star systems. Many arrived at their destinations before a Turn had passed, and began transmitting stellar and planetary data back to their creators. Eventually one of the Probes was noticed by a <a href="destroyer.html">Destroyer</a> sensor station. The Destroyers used data from the Probe's trajectory to determine its origin, and attacked the colonized planets of the <a href="lumen.html">Lumen</a> system.</p>

				<p>After the Destruction, when the Remnant had gathered into the Womb, the Rulers convened a <a href="great_council.html">Great Council</a>, and judged the Explorers responsible for drawing the Destroyers to Lumen. The Rulers' Punishment was severe. The Explorers were disgraced, and lost their place on the Council. They would be confined to the Badlands, and were tasked with managing the Remnant's refuse. During the <a href="age.html#hidden">Hidden Age</a>, the Rulers did not grant the <a href="right_of_continuation.html">Right of Continuation</a> to any Explorers. Many Explorers chose to enter <a href="dormancy.html">Dormancy</a> rather than perish childless, hoping for a time when the Punishment had passed. It was into this grim situation that the <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider</a> was born.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> finds and is accompanied by the Companion, an Explorer. The Companion is the repentant Outsider, still living within his modified <a href="seed.html">Seed</a>, called the <a href="necrolith.html">Necrolith</a>. With CT-41's help, the Companion captures <a href="vopronash.html">Voronash</a> and all the <a href="fragment.html">Fragments</a> of <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a> in the Necrolith, and holds them captive so he and they can be expelled from <a href="creation.html">Creation</a>.</p>

				<a id="farmer"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Farmer</div>

				<p>The Farmers were a <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Native</a> <a href="#high_lineage">High Lineage</a> with an affinity for the lower creatures of the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>. Primarily occupied with tending the <a href="deep_root.html">Deep Roots</a> that grew in their <a href="root_field.html">Root Fields</a>, the Farmers also domesticated many lifeforms, creating allies and pets. The Farmers were the first friends of the <a href="#laborer">Laborer</a>, and worked closely with the <a href="#healer">Healers</a> in the hopes of one day uplifting them fully into Lumene society.</p>

				<p>The Farmers' line began to branch away from the Healers' shortly before the <a href="tribal_wars.html">Tribal Wars</a>, and this change was codified during the first <a href="great_council.html">Great Council</a>. After the War, the newly named Farmers returned to their ravaged caverns above the <a href="magma_chamber.html">Magma Chambers</a>, which became their <a href="locus.html">Locus</a>. Though hostilities had ceased, they were forever wary of <a href="#explorer">Explorers</a>, and <a href="#warrior">Warriors</a> especially, who had invaded their homeland and eaten their brethren.</p>

				<p>Farmers tended the Deep Roots that grew above the Magma Chambers, breeding them over time to be more productive. When the Explorers and Warriors captured creatures in the <a href="wild.html">Wild</a>, the Farmers took them, and gently did what they could to pacify and domesticate them. Many of the creatures that <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> encountered in its explorations of the <a href="realm.html">Realm</a> were descended from Native pets and beasts of burden.</p>

				<p>Some Farmers were allowed maintain the Warriors' <a href="menagerie.html">Menagerie</a> after the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a>. They brought creatures found in the Wild there, and bred Native <a href="pet.html">Pets</a>. The most important lifeform they raised was a <a href="poto_native.html">Proto-Native</a>, which was awakened from <a href="dormancy.html">Dormancy</a> by the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a>. Farmers working near the <a href="womb.html">Womb</a> found the terrified creature, and brought it to the Menagerie.</p>

				<p>The Farmers, excited by the prospect of uplifting their cousin to rationality, began to breed the organism for robustness, reason and docility. They soon introduced the Proto-Native to the Healers, who greatly accelerated the Farmers' efforts to raise its consciousness. Though this Proto-Native and its descendents never developed the same intelligence as Natives of the High Lineages, and did not possess the mind of the <a href="lumene_minds.html#luminary">Luminary</a>, they did develop to the point that they could communicate with other Natives, operate simple machinery, and perform meaningful labor.</p>

				<p>After the Destruction, many Farmers from the surface returned to their ancestral Locus. The <a href="faithful.html">Faithful</a>, a population of Farmers that had never left the Underground, remained in the <a href="lower_root_fields.html">Lower Root Fields</a>, and did not welcome their more adventuresome brethren into their portion of the Locus. The Farmers from the surface thus tended the <a href="upper_root_fields.html">Upper Root Fields</a>, and built new facilities in the chambers surrounding them. They carefully cut back the Deep Roots to prevent <a href="overgrowth.html">Overgrowths</a> from forming, harvested <a href="flow.html">Flow</a>, and bred <a href="flesh_sac.html">Flesh Sacs</a>. They trained the <a href="laborer.html">Laborers</a> who dwelt among them to deliver food to the <a href="remnant.html">Remnant</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> finds and is accompanied by the <a href="seed.html">Seed</a> of a Farmer, one of the <a href="faithful.html">Faithful</a>, called the <a href="companions.html#groundskeeper">Groundskeeper</a>.</p>

				<a id="healer"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Healer</div>

				<p>The Healers were a <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Native</a> <a href="#high_lineage">High Lineage</a> dedicated to the preservation of Lumene life and health. The Healers treated all manner of physical and psychological diseases and injuries in their <a href="locus.html">Locus</a> and throughout the <a href="realm.html">Realm</a>. After being introduced to a <a href="proto_native.html">Proto-Native</a> organism found by the <a href="#farmer">Farmers</a>, the Healers became attached to them, advocated for them at many <a href="great_council.html">Great Councils</a>, and invested heavily in the <a href="#laborer">Laborers</a>' enlightenment, well-being and integration.</p>

				<p>The Healers emerged as a unique behavioral and physiological population before the <a href="tribal_wars.html">Tribal Wars</a>, but as with the other Lineages, it was during the War that they distinguished themselves in their role. The science of medicine and psychology advanced greatly during the conflict, and the Healers lent great aid to the coalition of Nurturers and Philosophers by tending to the wounded. During the first Great Council, the Healers were named a Lineage, and their <a href="progenitor.html">Progenitor</a> was identified. In the aftermath of the conflict the Healers treated many of the <a href="#warrior">Warriors</a> and <a href="#explorer">Explorers</a> who had been hobbled in combat, and earned their lasting respect. They also began developing theories of psychological health and healing as they dealt with minds damaged by combat.</p>

				<p>During the first Great Council the Healers decided to move to the western side of the <a href="womb.html">Womb</a>, away from the Farmers' Locus, where they could forge their unique identity. There they devoted themselves to their craft, and learned much about the function of the Lumene Native body, and the complex interactions of the <a href="lumene_minds.html">Lumene minds</a>.</p>

				<p>After the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a>, when the Farmers brought the Proto-Native to the Healers, the Healers began to develop the science of education, which had hitherto been largely ignored, as Native young were born already blessed with the knowledge and identities of their parents and ancestors. The Farmers and Healers taught the Proto-Native what they could, and it became capable of meaningful contribution to the <a href="kindred.html">Kindred</a>. During this process of teaching, new methods and benefits of communication were discovered.</p>

				<p>When they deemed the time was right, the Healers advocated that their adopted children to be acknowledged as a new Lineage. After all Lineages voiced their opinions in Council, the <a href="#ruler">Rulers</a> judged in the Laborers' favor. The Laborers joined the six existing Lineages, and gained a seat at the Council. After the Laborers' official acceptance into Lumene society, the Healers continued to teach them and represent their interests.  Though the Laborers were dispersed throughout the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a> after they became a Lineage, and had no official Locus, many chose to make their homes just above the Healers' Locus, to be close to their friends.</p>

				<p>After the Destruction the Healers administered aid to those Natives who had been unable to congregate under the <a href="uraninite_vein.html">Uraninite Vein</a>, and had suffered radiation burns from the blasts of <a href="destroyer.html">Destroyer</a> <a href="gateway.html">Gateways</a>. The Healers continued to do their work unobtrusively for many <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html#turn">Turns</a>, but were quietly critical of the Explorers' <a href="destruction.html#punishment">Punishment</a> by the Rulers. When the <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider</a> returned from hiding, psychological experts among the Healers argued that he was technically no longer an Explorer, and therefore exempt from the Punishment.</p>

				<p>As <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a> began to exert influence upon Lumene Natives, the Healers treated many Laborers who suffered from strange and painful thoughts that they could not fully articulate. The Healers were troubled by the unrest of the Laborers, and sensed the coming conflict. After many Turns of <a href="subjugation.html">Subjugation</a>, and the <a href="hollowing.html">Hollowing</a> of the Laborers, it was a Healer, the <a href="companions.html#deliverer">Deliverer</a>, who released the Remnant from Thosmodeme's control by inventing the <a href="secret_thought.html">Secret Thought</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> finds and is accompanied by the <a href="seed.html">Seed</a> of the Deliverer.</p>

				<a id="ruler"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Ruler</div>

				<p>The Rulers were a <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Native</a> <a href="high_lineage">High Lineage</a> which presided at <a href="great_council.html">Great Councils</a>, created law, passed judgment, managed trade, and at a broad level, worked to advantageously steer the course of the <a href="kindred.html">Kindred</a>.

				<p>The Rulers' Lineage was a branch of the <a href="#philosopher">Philosophers</a>', and as such each Ruler inherited an awareness of the <a href="lumene_minds.html#transcendence">Transcendence</a>. The Rulers gained preeminence among the Lineages during the <a href="tribal_wars.html">Tribal Wars</a>, due to their communicative nature and ability to orchestrate the efforts of their peers. After the War, the Rulers were appointed to create law, and regulate the territories and roles of each Lineage. The Rulers saw it as their mission was to create a properly balanced, ordered and sustainable society.</p>

				<p>By negotiating a just peace after the Tribal Wars, the Rulers gained the <a href="#warrior">Warriors</a> as friends and allies. The Rulers did what they could to incorporate the Warriors into Lumene society, channelling the Warriors' innate aggression and propensity for violence toward useful ends. The Warriors became the Rulers' executors, confronting threats and enforcing Lumene law. The Warriors felt a fierce loyalty to the Rulers, and considered it an honor to serve them. The <a href="#explorer">Explorers</a>, however, were never truly conquered as the Warriors had been, and occasionally flaunted the Rulers' judgments and counsel.</p>

				<p>After the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a> the Rulers convened an emergency Great Council, in which several judgments were pronounced. The Explorers were found to be primarily responsible for drawing the <a href="destroyer.html">Destroyers</a> to the <a href="lumen.html">Lumen</a> system, against the Rulers' objections. The Rulers mandated a harsh <a href="destruction.html#punishment">Punishment</a> for the Explorers, removing them from the Council, and banishing them to the <a href="badlands.html">Badlands</a>, where they would manage the <a href="remnant.html">Remnant's</a> garbage. The Rulers also forbade all Natives from returning to the surface, fearing that they might be detected by Destroyers.</p>

				<p>Due to shortages of food and space suffered by the Remnant in the <a href="age.html#hidden">Hidden Age</a>, the Rulers made death the penalty for unauthorized reproduction. They granted the <a href="right_of_continuation.html">Right of Continuation</a> fewer and fewer nominated Natives. Reproduction became a highly political process. Advocates represented the Native in question, extolling their virtues, while other motivated Natives had the opportunity to oppose the extension of the Right.</p>

				<p>After the Destruction, the Rulers <a href="sanctification.html">Sanctified</a> the <a href="locus.html">Locus</a> of the Warriors who had saved the Remnant by their <a href="destruction.html#sacrifice">Sacrifice</a>. It was immaculately preserved to honor the Warriors, and no Native was allowed to take permanent residence there. Near the end of the Hidden Age the <a href="#laborer">Laborers</a> asked to be given the Warriors' Locus, but the Rulers considered it more practical for them to inherit the Badlands, as the Explorers entered <a href="dormancy.html">Dormancy</a> or died out.</p>

				<p>With the Warriors gone, the Rulers needed loyal constables and soldiers to enforce their judgments. They worked with the <a href="#engineer">Engineers</a> and <a href="#healer">Healers</a> to construct <a href="executor.html">Executors</a>. These robotic lifeforms would protect sensitive areas and enforce the Rulers' decrees. The Rulers were no longer loved by the Remnant as they had been before the Destruction, and Executors were seen as embodiments of oppression. During the <a href="subjugation.html">Subjugation</a>, Laborers sealed both Rulers and Executors in the Rulers' Locus, before flooding it with boiling water.</p>

				<p>The Warriors were a <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Native</a> <a href="#high_lineage">High Lineage</a> of large and aggressive individuals that lived in their <a href="locus.html">Locus</a> above and to the east of the <a href="sea.html">Sea</a>. They were drawn to battle and the hunt, and followed the <a href="#explorer">Explorers</a> on their journeys more readily than the other Lineages. The Warriors trained for combat in the <a href="frontier.html#arena">Arena</a> and the <a href="labyrinth.html">Labyrinth</a>, and protected Natives of all Lineages from <a href="rogue.html">Rogues</a>, <a href="beast.html">Beasts</a>, criminals, and any other phsyical threats. No Warriors were present in the <a href="womb.html">Womb</a> during the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a>, and in the aftermath of their <a href="destruction.html#sacrifice">Sacrifice</a> the <a href="remnant.html">Remnant</a> believed their Lineage to be extinct.</p>

				<p>The Warriors began to branch away from the <a href="ancestral_lineage">Ancestral Lineage</a> of the <a href="#adventurer">Adventurer</a> long before the <a href="tribal_wars.html">Tribal Wars</a>, soon after settling east of the Sea. The lower creatures of their home caverns were many and dangerous, and in an era before tool use, the yet unnamed Warriors evolved great strength, size and dexterity to protect themselves, and to hunt.</p>

				<p>When the Warriors had risen to supremacy in their home caverns, they became more numerous than the game in their <a href="hunting_grounds.html">Hunting Grounds</a> could sustain. Above them the Explorers hunted the innumerables herds of the <a href="migration.html">Migration</a>, while below them the <a href="#farmer">Farmers</a> tended vast fields of <a href="deep_root.html">Deep Roots</a>. The Warriors first began to raid the Explorers' caverns, which would later become the <a href="upper_ruins.html">Upper Ruins</a>. When the Explorers were overwhelmed by the Warriors, they sued for peace. They joined the Warriors and served as scouts, seeking out new hunting grounds and plunder.</p>

				<p>When the Warriors and Explorers began to attack the Farmers and their <a href="root_fields.html">Root Fields</a>, the stage was set for the Tribal Wars. Though the Adventurers won the earlier stages of the War, eventually they were forced back to their home caverns. In the Arena of their ancient home the Warriors readied themselves for a glorious end in death, but the attack never came. Instead, the <a href="#ruler">Rulers</a> invited the Warriors to a <a href="great_council.html">Great Council</a>, in which a peace would be discussed.</p>

				<p>During this first Great Council, the defeated Warriors were not punished for their aggression, and were allowed by the Rulers to preserve their identity and dignity. They were offered and gladly accepted the task of defending the newly formed <a href="realm.html">Realm</a> from internal and external threats. Ever after the Warriors were fiercely loyal to the Rulers.</p>

				<p>After the Tribal Wars, the Warriors fought, and captured or killed, Beasts and other creatures that encroached on Native territory from the <a href="wild.html">Wild</a>. They sought out and pacified Rogue individuals and clusters, and under the Rulers' direction brought Native criminals to the <a href="regression_center.html">Regression Center</a>. They tended the <a href="flesh_vats.html">Flesh Vats</a> and hunted their own food in the Wild, and did not depend solely on the Farmers' <a href="flow.html">Flow</a> for sustenance.</p>

				<p>During the Destruction, none of the Warriors on <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a> heeded the Rulers' call to congregate to the Womb. Instead they chose to pilot spacefaring hundreds of spacefaring vessels against <a href="destroyer.html">Destroyer</a> <a href="gateway.html">Gateways</a> and escort vessels during the Sacrifice. As such, no Warriors survived to join the Remnant. In the aftermath of the Destruction the Warrior's Locus was <a href="sanctification.html">Sanctified</a> by the Rulers, and meticulously maintained by Laborers and others to commemorate their Sacrifice. No other Natives were allowed to take up residence there.</p>

				<p>During the <a href="age.html#hidden">Hidden Age</a>, certain Warriors were immortalized by having their <a href="seed.html">Seeds</a> housed within powerful <a href="executor.html">Executor</a> bodies. These Executors, commisioned by the Rulers and built by <a href="#engineer">Engineers</a> and <a href="#healer">Healers</a>, allowed certain Warriors to continue carrying out the will of the Rulers in death.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Laborer</div>

				<p>The Laborers were the penultimate <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Native</a> Lineage to be named. They were distinct from the <a href="high_lineage.html">High Lineages</a>, and neither descended from the <a href="common_ancestor.html">Common Ancestor</a>, nor possessed the mind of the <a href="lumene_minds#luminary.html">Luminary</a>. For many <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html#turn">Turns</a> during the <a href="age.html#hidden">Hidden Age</a> the Laborers lived among the High Lineages, and aided them in their works. However, during the <a href="subjugation.html">Subjugation</a> the Laborers' minds became <a href="hollowing.html">Hollowed</a>, and their Lineage perished.</a>

				<p>The Laborers descended from a <a href="proto_native.html">Proto-Native</a> lifeform which entered <a href="dormancy.html">Dormancy</a> during the <a href="pre_tribal_extinction.html">Pre-Tribal Extinction</a>. This creature remained in Dormancy for hundreds of Turns, until it was awakened by the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a>. Certain <a href="#farmer">Farmers</a> of the <a href="remnant.html">Remnant</a> discovered the frightened creature, and brought it to their <a href="locus.html">Locus</a>. The Farmers, who had an affinity for the lower lifeforms of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>, fed their new curiosity, and did what they could to set it at ease.</p>

				<p>The Farmers who studied the creature found that it did not possess the same intelligence as Natives of the High Lineages, though its physical form was similar. For several Turns they bred the Proto-Native, attempting to produce docility, health and elevated thought. Their efforts were met with limited success, and they appealed to their brethren the <a href="#healer">Healers</a> for aid.</p>

				<p>The Healers, rather than simply trying to breed intelligence, also taught the Proto-Natives. The education of lesser beings was a relatively novel concept in Lumene society at the time, since Natives were born as nearly exact mental copies of their parents, and had limited need for instruction regarding their role. The Healers learned a great deal about the transmission of knowledge as they taught their students.</p>

				<p>The Proto-Native organisms took an immediate liking to the Healers that worked with them, and made rapid progess. Though they never developed the Luminary or an equivalent mind, the Proto-Natives learned a simplified version of <a href="standard_lumene.html">Standard Lumene</a>, and were able to express their thoughts, fears and desires to each other and to the High Lineages.</p>

				<p>As part of their education, the Healers sent Proto-Natives to live with other Lineages, to learn from them as they worked. For nearly a Turn the Proto-natives assisted the six High Lineages in their labors as they were able, and made their homes throughout the <a href="realm.html">Realm</a>. Though they were dispersed, Proto-Native populations tended to cluster near the Loci of the Farmers, and the Healers especially.</p>

				<p>When the <a href="#nurturer">Nurturers</a> felt the time was right, they asked that the Proto-Native be named a Lineage. At the third <a href="great_council.html">Great Council</a> after the Destruction, a Proto-Native was elevated on the Healer's dais in the <a href="assembly_hall.html">Assembly Hall</a>, and asked to be recognized as a Lineage, citing its own desire and that of its brethren. After some debate, in which the Nurturers advocated for their adopted children by citing their intelligence and contributions to Lumene society, the <a href="#ruler">Rulers</a> judged in their favor, and the Lineage of the Laborer was named.</p>

				<p>The Laborers became valuable workers, and assisted other Natives in their pursuits. They constructed a shrine dedicated to their <a href="progenitor.html">Progenitor</a> at the center of the <a href="laborers_pool.html">Laborer's Pool</a>, in the very chamber where he slept through the ages. They became the most numerous Lineage, even as the <a href="right_of_continuation.html">Right of Continuation</a> was granted to fewer and fewer Kinsmen of other Lineages.</p>

				<p>After the <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider</a> built his <a href="altar.html">Altars</a> and the Remnant began to use them, <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a> took shape in the lower-western portion of the Realm. The Laborers were the first Lumene Natives with whom he communed. Due to their relatively simple minds, Thosmodeme was able to <a href="synchronization.html">Synchronize</a> with Laborers far more quickly and easily than with Natives of the High Lineages.</p>

				<p>By speaking to the Laborers as if he were an <a href="old_god.html">Old God</a>, Thosmodeme was able to stir them up to indignant anger. He told them the Rulers had become false gods, had punished the <a href="#explorer">Explorers</a> unduly, exploited the Laborers' toil, and enforced their whimsical laws with <a href="abomination.html">Abominations</a>. The Rulers repeatedly denied the Laborers' petitions to live in the <a href="#warrior">Warriors'</a> Locus, and Thosmodeme used this grievance to inspire them to a great work. Under his guidance, and to the astonishment of the <a href="kindred.html">Kindred</a>, the Laborers constructed the <a href="temple.html">Temple</a> of Thosmodeme.</p>

				<p>When Thosmodeme knew that the time was right, he urged the numerous Laborers to rise up as one against the unsuspecting Rulers. Again with his assistance, the Laborers sealed the Rulers' Locus and flooded it with boiling water, and afterward quickly took control of the Realm. Thosmodeme then revealed himself openly to the remaining Lineages, ushering in the Subjugation and the <a href="age.html#dark">Dark Age</a>.</p>

				<p>After many Turns under Thosmodeme's control, the Laborers' minds began to weaken, and then collapse entirely. Thosmodeme did not consider the <a href="lumene_minds.html#simpleton">Simpleton</a> to be an interesting mind, and chose to override it rather than interact with it meaningfully. The Laborers began to be Hollowed, losing the ability to think without interventive direction. Eventually they lost basic motor function, and when left unattended by Thosmodeme, they withered and died. Thosmodeme, seeing the Laborers as inferior <a href="child.html">Children</a>, released them from his control, and the Lineage perished.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Angel</div>

				<p>Angels were the offspring of the <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider</a>, birthed after he was changed by <a href="voronash.html">Voronash</a>. They included the Ishim, Cherubim, Malakim, and Seraphim that dwelt in the <a href="nucleus.html#second_temple">Second Temple</a>, the <a href="chayot_ha_kodesh.html">Chayot ha Kodesh</a> that guarded the <a href="holy_of_holies.html">Holy of Holies</a>, and the exalted Outsider himself, Metatron. Angels possessed incredible speed, intelligence and power, greater than any natural <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Native</a>, and were among the most challenging foes <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> encountered during its life on <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, CT-41 destroys the mass accumulator of the <a href="paralus.html">Paralus</a>' <a href="tunneling.html">Tunnel Drive</a>, and prevents the Paralus from leaving Lumen 2. Voronash and the Outsider return to the <a href="nucleus.html">Nucleus</a>, and while CT-41 continues its explorations, the master and apprentice expand the <a href="nucleus.html#laboratory">Laboratory</a>. While CT-41 ascends the <a href="mountainside.html">Mountainside</a> and speaks with <a href="farsight_crew.html#vadim_kozlov">Vadim</a> in the <a href="mountainside.html#hermits_cave">Hermit's Cave</a>, the Outsider is changed by Voronash, and begins to birth his children, the Angels of Voronash.</p>

				<p>As the Outsider is continually exalted by Voronash, his new progeny gain his attributes. The Angels therefore take many forms, each representing some stage of the Outsider's transformation. By the time CT-41 enters the Holy of Holies to destroy Voronash, the Outsider appears nearly identical to the dead Outsider CT-41 found in the <a href="ancestral_halls.html">Ancestral Halls</a>.</p>

				<p>The Angels, as disciples of Voronash, aid him in his ambitions to challenge the <a href="creator.html">Creator</a>. They hunt all life in the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a> to extinction, bringing captured <a href="self.html">Selves</a> to their lord. They break apart the smallest building blocks of <a href="creation.html">Creation</a>, so Voronash can devour the ancient Selves that animate them. They build strange <a href="altar.html">Altars</a> to trap curious strangers that peer into Creation. The Outsider himself studies the <a href="prime_altar.html">Prime Altar</a>, to see how it might be used to travel to the past.</p>

				<p>After CT-41 uses the <a href="../items.html#lawgiver">Lawgiver</a> to destroy the <a href="simulacrum.html">Simulacrum</a>, it moves into the Second Temple where the Angels dwell. Many of these servants of Voronash will speak to CT-41 through its <a href="../items.html#ulf_radio">ULF Radio</a> as it moves through their home.</p>
