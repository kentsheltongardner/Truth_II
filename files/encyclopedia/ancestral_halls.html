				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Ancestral Halls were a complex of beautifully decorated chambers near the <a href="quarry.html">Quarry</a>, wherein shrines were dedicated to the <a href="progenitor.html">Progenitors</a> of the various <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> <a href="lineage.html">Lineages</a>. Construction of the Ancestral Halls began during the third <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html#turn">Turn</a> of the <a href="age.html#enlightened">Enlightened Age</a>, when the <a href="tribal_wars">Tribal Wars</a> was only a memory and the <a href="kindred.html">Kindred</a> had acheived a stable society.</p>

				<p>Each shrine within the Ancestral Halls contained a statue of a Progenitor. The Halls were arranged as a branching structure of chambers, from the <a href="common_ancestor.html">Common Ancestor</a> at the base, to the <a href="lineage.html#ancestral_lineage">Ancestral Lineages</a>, to the <a href="lineage.html#high_lineage">High Lineages</a> at the top.</p>

				<p>No chamber was set aside for the <a href="lineage.html#laborer">Laborer</a> in the Ancestral Halls, since at the time of their construction the Progenitor of the Laborers had not yet been discovered. When the Laborers were admitted into the Kindred, it was difficult to add their shrine to the Halls, since their Lineage diverged from all others before the birth of the Common Ancestor. As such, the Laborers constructed their own shrine, at the center of the pool where their <a href="proto_native.html">Proto-Native</a> ancestor slept during his long <a href="dormancy.html">Dormancy</a>.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> defeats the Bronze <a href="executor.html">Executor</a> that stands guard at the entrance to the Ancestral Halls. After moving through the various shrine chambers, CT-41 finds the dead <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider</a> and the <a href="necrolith.html">Necrolith</a> perched atop the Explorer's Shrine. The <a href="commentary.html">Commentary</a> converses with CT-41 from within the Necrolith, and joins it in its journey.</p>

				<p>Soon thereafter, CT-41 discovers it is trapped in the Explorer's shrine chamber. It finds an <a href="items.html#impulse_cannon">Impulse Cannon</a> that had been used to deface the Explorer's shrine, and blasts apart cracked stone in the wall of the chamber to escape.</p>
