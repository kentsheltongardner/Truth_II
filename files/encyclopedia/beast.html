				<p>Beasts were large predators that stalked the <a href="wild.html">Wild</a>, and were dangerous foes even for <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene</a> <a href="lineage.html#warrior">Warriors</a>. They were aggressive yet cunning predators, stalking their prey and learning its habits before viciously attacking. Beast populations were highest near their nests just beyond the <a href="hunting_grounds.html">Hunting Grounds</a>, but individual Beasts could be found all throughout the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>. Beasts kept bone pits where they hoarded the remains of their victims, using the trophies as mnemonic devices to help them ruminate on lessons learned from their battles.</p>

				<p>In the <a href="age.html#tribal.html">Tribal Age</a>, Beasts and Warriors contended for the same prey in the Hunting Grounds. The Warriors, due to their higher intelligence and great physical strength, gained the advantage over Beasts in most of their encounters. As such, Beasts came to hate and fear Lumene Natives. During the <a href="tribal_wars.html">Tribal Wars</a>, a band of Warriors and <a href="lineage.html#explorer">Explorers</a> under the command of the <a href="companions.html#tribesman">Tribesman</a> became trapped near a Beasts' nest after a <a href="cave_in.html">Cave-In</a>. The band destroyed the more numerous Beasts, though all Natives but the Tribesman were also killed.</p>

				<p>On #DATE, while cataloguing lifeforms in the <a href="caverns.html">Caverns</a>, <a href="nicholas_ormeil.html">Nicholas Ormeil</a> was killed by a Beast, and dragged to its bone pit. Prior to the attack, Ormeil had been able to frighten the Beast with his <a href="../items.html#flashlight">Flashlight</a>. The Beast was influenced by <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a> to kill Ormeil, who was close to discovering Native structure in the <a href="desolation.html">Desolation</a> earlier than Thosmodeme desired. The Beast could not eat Ormeil, due to differences in chemical structure between Lumene and terrestrial organisms, and Ormeil's remains were left undisturbed.</p>

				<p>During the <a href="uprising.html">Uprising</a> against Thosmodeme, Beasts were instrumental in defeating the rebellious Natives. A large army of lesser <a href="servants.html">Servants</a>, bolstered by vengeful Beasts, attacked and scattered the gathered Natives in the <a href="assembly_hall.html">Assembly Hall</a>. Afterwards Beasts were given a special place in Thosmodeme's kingdom, and were bred by <a href="uruthmu.html">Uruthmu</a> into powerful Servants called <a href="guard.html">Guards</a>.</p>
				
				<div class="entry-section-title">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> enters the <a href="beasts_den.html">Den</a> of the Beast that attacked Ormeil, and kills it. After the battle, CT-41 explores the cavern and finds Ormeil's remains, along with his <a href="personal_data_recorder.html">PDR</a> and Ensign's <a href="rank_card.html">Rank Card</a>. As CT-41 explores more of the Underground, it encounters several other Beasts, primarily near their nests east of the Hunting Grounds.</p>
