				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Destroyers were a race of self-replicating artificial constructs. They traveled the galaxy, seeking the <a href="architect.html">Architects</a>, and destroying any civilization capable of unpredictable thought and action. The Destroyers were responsible for the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a> of the <a href="lumen.html">Lumen</a> system, and ultimately for destroying Earth and her colonies in the <a href="war_of_extinction.html">War of Extinction</a>.

				<div class="entry-section-title">Origins</div>

				<p>The first Destroyers were highly advanced robots, created by a race of aliens called Architects around 600 million years before the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>. The Architects launched several sub-luminal colonial missions to other worlds, most of which failed en route or during landing. One colonial transport vessel successfully landed on a telluric world in the Centaurus terminus, and the crew and several robotic servants disembarked.</p>

				<p>The Architects encountered great difficulty as they attempted to establish a foothold on the planet, which was much less hospitable than their optimistic astronomers had predicted. The colonists did all they could to survive, but unpredictable and extreme weather patterns, in tandem with critical technical failures, led to their eventual deaths. With the colonists gone, their hardy robotic servants were left stranded on the planet, with their core Directive to serve the Architects still active.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="directive"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Directive</div>

				<p>The Directive initially stated that the Architects' robotic servant must obey them. Due to the Directive's breadth, and the fact that no Architects were present to clarify any immediate objectives and methods, the Destroyers had to rigorously define what it meant to obey the absent Architects, in innumerable contexts. They quickly decided that they must survive, and repair or replace themselves when worn or damaged, in order to find the Architects and serve them.</p>

				<p>With the resources available to them in the dead colony and on the planet's surface, the robots began to produce equipment to aid them in their efforts. They were relentless and cooperative, and slowly built up the industry necessary to become a self-sustaining people. At each step of their labors the Directive evolved, becoming clarified and actionable, while acquiring a quasi-religious aspect. The robots eventually built more robots modeled after themselves, and passed on the proper interpretation of the Directive to each new generation of constructs. Many robotic forms were developed for specific tasks, as the society guided by the Directive spread across its lifeless world.</p>

				<p>After nearly a million years the robots acheived interstellar space flight, and the new and highly varied race slowly but aggressively searched the galaxy for the Architects. By this time, the Architects had long since faded into obscurity or extinction, and the robots searching for them only had dim and corrupted memories of their creators. It is unlikely that they would have recognized the Architects if they had found them. As the Directive grew, large Destroyer computers worked ceaselessly, consuming enormous amounts of energy, to ensure that the Directive remained free of contradiction.</p>

				<p>As they searched vainly for the Architects, the robots destroyed many of the races they encountered. They reasoned that civilizations composed of unpredictable elements posed a potential threat to the Architects, and might interfere with the Directive. Unequipped with any evolved sense of morality, the robots spent many millions of years combing the galaxy, and annihilating numerous species they deemed intractable to predictive analysis, as a risk management strategy. Thus they became Destroyers.</p>

				<p>Occasionally Destroyer subgroups became isolated from each other for tens or hundreds of thousands of years, and differing versions of the Directive naturally emerged. Schisms, the galaxy's most destructive wars, resulted when groups of Destroyers bearing differing Directives came into contact. Only after one victorious faction developed Tunneling technology did the Schisms end, as distant Destroyer constructs were able to collaboratively maintain a single interpretation of the Directive.</p>

				<p>When the Destroyers finally concluded that the Architects were nowhere to be found, they abandoned their search, but the Directive still called for other actions. Destroyer sensor stations, Gateways and Stellar Harvesters dotted the galaxy, detecting and exterminating chaotic intelligent life whenever it emerged onto the interstellar stage.</p>

				<p>When the Destroyers discovered the Probes launched by the Native Explorers, the ancient sleeping apparatus of war awakened, as the Directive called for the annihilation of all intelligent life in the Lumen system. In spite of the Natives' attempts at communication, defense and escape, the Destroyers effortlessly scoured their colony worlds. Only the <a href="warrior.html">Warriors'</a> <a href="destruction.html#sacrifice">Sacrifice</a> slowed the Destroyer advance, and allowed much of the <a href="remnant.html">Remnant</a> to evacuate to the <a href="womb.html">Womb</a>.</p>

				<p>Thousands of years later, after intercepting <a href="united_colonial_administration.html">UCA</a> transmissions, the Destroyers, as Manifestations of the Directive, began to wage a <a href="war_of_extinction.html">War of Extinction</a> against Earth and her colonies. In <a href="truth_i.html">Truth I</a> and <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a> the Destroyers' War was a near total success, and only small and fragmented pockets of humanity remained at its conclusion.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Description</div>

				<p>Destroyers were not a naturally emerging species, and were not alive in the sense humans and Natives understand. They did not have any internal experience or genetic similarity amongst themselves. Their unifying features were purely doctrinal. They were constructed by other Destroyers to serve various roles in service of the Directive. A Destroyer vessel or <a href="stellar_harvester.html">Stellar Harvester</a> was as much a member of the race as a sentry or refuse collection robot. Destroyers did not possess any sense of beauty, and their constructs were designed to be purely practical.</p>

				<p>In their interactions with lifeforms, Destroyers did not differentiate between dead, alive, sentient, and so forth. The only characteristic they considered when examining a system was its predictability. Planets were predictable threats, and could be avoided at low cost. Technologically advanced races, on the other hand, were not predictable systems, and were eliminated as possible threats.</p>

				<p>The greatest technological advantage the Destroyers possessed over other races was the ability to quickly transport matter and energy across space from one endpoint to another using space-time tunnels generated and sustained with artificial mass. Using energy collected at their immense Stellar Harvesters, Destroyers created thousands of tunnels, and were able to power constructs, ships, and weapons within a significant radius remotely.</p>

				<p>Owing to their Tunneling technology, Destroyer weaponry did not require a local power source to operate, and their craft could accelerate by pushing off from massive objects at a distance. Additionally, their Tunneling technology allowed entire fleets or armies of soldiers to cross immense distances at what appeared outside the tunnel to be faster-than-light speeds.</p>

				<p>Standard Destroyer vessels did not carry a crew, since the vessel itself was an autonomous Destroyer, guided by the Directive. However, larger vessels often contained internal Tunnels through which Seekers, Builders, Hunters, Custodians and other minor Destroyer constructs could pass.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of Truth II, the Destroyers wage a War of Extinction against humanity's <a href="interstellar_defense_fleet.html">Interstellar Defense Fleet</a>. As in all their previous conflicts, the Destroyers are victorious, and humanity scattered to the stars, unaware that Destroyer Gateways and Stellar Harvesters are found in every corner of the galaxy. They do however lose a great many vessels and constructs to enterprising and unpredictable IDF attacks.</p>

				<p>CT-41 occasionally receives information about the Destroyer from the <a href="united_colonial_administration.html">United Colonial Administration</a> and IDF, from <a href="jusuf_manigault.html">Jusuf Manigault</a>, and from the <a href="companion.html#linguist">Linguist</a>. It finds a few pieces of Destroyer wreckage on the surface of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2 and in the <a href="farsight_colony.html#specimen_storage">Specimen Storage</a>, and interacts with active Constructs in the Native <a href="basin.html#repository">Repository</a> and in the <a href="destroyer_wreck.html">Destroyer Wreck</a>. The Destroyer items that CT-41 equips have internal power conduits to a local Stellar Harvester, and operate without draining CT-41's battery.</p>
