				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>In Lumene biological taxonomy, 'Family' referred to all lifeforms that descended from a common ancestor. The collective progeny of any Lumene organism could be considered a unique Family, but only certain Families were considered sufficiently differentiable to be categorized, named, and studied. Generally, named Families emerged during periods of rapid change and extinction, when unfit organisms died out. The <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> <a href="kindred.html">Kindred</a> and all of its <a href="lineage.html">Lineages</a> were considered Families.</p>

				<p>The Family of Mensids included all Natives, <a href="proto_native.html">Proto-Natives</a>, and <a href="rogues.html">Rogues</a>. In the <a href="age.html#emergent">Emergent Age</a>, the first Mensids learned to find prey for the <a href="old_god.html">Old Gods</a>. As they aided the Old Gods in their hunts, Mensids began to develop heightened senses, systems of communication, agile movement, theories of mind and tool use. When the Old Gods disappeared during the <a href="pre_tribal_extinction.html">Pre-Tribal Extinction</a>, the intelligence and ability of the Mensids increased as they moved to take the Old Gods' place atop the Lumene food chain.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> encounters many different families of Lumene animals. Though individual organisms differ physically based on their age and location, all members of a Family posses commonalities that suggest their common ancestry. Certain Lumene Families feature prominently in CT-41's journeys.</p>
