				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Farsight Expedition was a monumental effort to visit, study and colonize <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>, orchestrated by the <a href="united_colonial_administration.html">United Colonial Administration</a> and funded by several Earth governments. The Expedition was a partial success, in that the <a href="argo.html">Argo</a> reached Lumen 2 and the <a href="farsight_colony.html">Farsight Colony</a> was constructed, but <a href="cobbs_mutiny.html">Cobb's Mutiny</a> put an end to the UCA's further ambitions for the Expedition. After #YEAR, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> was the only remaining active member of the Farsight Expedition.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Background</div>

				<p>After strange markings on planets in the Lumen system were discovered by the <a href="large_interstellar_surveyor_telescope.html">LIST</a> in #YEAR, the United Colonial Administration leadership cautiously considered the idea of sending a manned expedition to investigate. Information about the Lumen system was considered sensitive, and the threat of heavy criminal penalties kept the information from becoming public.</p>

				<p>A small observation staff monitored the system for several years, and tried to detect any signs of intelligent activity beyond the scarrings on the surfaces of Lumen 2, <a href="lumen_3.html">Lumen 3</a>, and <a href="lumen_4.html">Lumen 4</a>. When the Administration was confident that there was no activity suggestive of extant advanced civilization in the system, Administration scientists and logistics engineers began drawing up plans for an Expedition.</p>

				<p>The Expeditionary committee determined that Lumen 2 was the best candidate planet for colonization in the Lumen system, due to its relatively Earth-like atmosphere and size, though the length of its day was foreseeable difficulty. Another technical concern was the vast distance between Sol and the Lumen system. Lumen was much further from Earth than other colonial stars, and getting to Lumen 2 within a reasonable timeframe would require a far larger spacecraft than had ever been made.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Preparations</div>

				<p>The Colonial Administration approached renowned physicist and aerospace engineer <a href="farsight_crew.html#vadim_kozlov">Vadim Kozlov</a> at Lightyear Propulsion, and asked him to help design the <a href="interstellar_propulsion_system.html">ISPS</a> and the Argo. He accepted the offer, on the condition that he be aboard the Argo when it left the Solar system. The Administration agreed, and Kozlov became the first official member of the Farsight Expedition. With the financial backing of the Administration's member governments, engineers at Lightyear began to design, prototype and build the Expedition's hardware.</p>

				<p>As the construction of the ISPS neared completion at the <a href="la_diosa_shipyard.html">La Diosa Shipyard</a>, other candidates for the command crew and research leads were approached for interviews. <a href="farsight_crew.html#william_garrett">William Garrett</a>, <a href="farsight_crew.html#otis_cobb">Otis Cobb</a>, <a href="farsight_crew.html#jessica_arai">Jessica Arai</a>, <a href="farsight_crew.html#kiaan_sood">Kiaan Sood</a>, <a href="farsight_crew.html#marco_badawi">Marco Badawi</a>, <a href="farsight_crew.html#ines_orozco">Ines Orozco</a>, <a href="farsight_crew.html#nicholas_ormeil">Nicholas Ormeil</a>, <a href="farsight_crew.html#karl_westfahl">Karl Westfahl</a>, and <a href="farsight_crew.html#louis_zhang">Louis Zhang</a> were selected from a huge candidate pool to join the Expedition, due their expertise in their respective fields, and some political considerations. All command staff and science leads received extensive training from Administration experts on a wide range of relevant topics, from nutrition, exercise, and psychology, to orbital mechancis, material science and astrophysics.</p>

				<p>The Administration then assembled the work crews and military units that would help to build and protect the Farsight Colony. The final human component to be added to the expedition was a large civilian population, consisting mostly of young, healthy, and adventurous married couples. After signing the <a href="expeditionary_contract.html">Expeditionary Contract</a>, each member of the Expedition was shipped to the La Diosa Shipyard. Their communications were screened by Administration officials, to prevent any specific information about the Expedition getting out to the public and compromising the cautiously guarded mission.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Journey</div>

				<p>On #DATE the last Expedition crew members entered their cryo pods on the Argo's hibernation decks, and were placed in <a href="cryostasis.html">Cryostasis</a>. Over the next two weeks the Argo was loaded with supplies such as unassembled <a href="caretaker.html">Caretaker</a> Colonial Assistants, after which the Argo was attached to the ISPS. After being tugged to its launch position the ISPS fired its antimatter rocket, beginning the first acceleration phase of its journey.</p>

				<p>As the ISPS approached the Lumen system its maneuvering thrusters reversed it its orientation before the antimatter rocket began its second burn, slowing the ISPS from the relativistic speed at which it had crossed interstellar space. A skeleton command and science team was brought out of stasis by <a href="cici.html">CICI</a> as the ISPS crossed the threshold into the system. Once the crew completed scans of the Lumene planets, Commander Garrett moved the ISPS into orbit around Lumen 2. He and his advisors considered potential landing zones for the Argo, and ultimately elected to touch down near the eastern edge of the Fortuna Crater. The Argo detached from the ISPS, fired its maneuvering rockets to begin its descent, and performed a successful landing on the Lumene surface at #TIME, #DATE.</p>
