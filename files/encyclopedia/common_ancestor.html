				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Common Ancestor was the first true <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Native</a>, distinguished from its relatives by the mind of the <a href="lumene_minds.html#luminary">Luminary</a> that it carried. It evolved in the pre-technological <a href="age.html#tribal">Tribal Age</a>, before the species branched into the <a href="lineage.html#ancestral_lineage">Ancestral Lineages</a>.</p>

				<p>When the Common Ancestor acheived rationality, it struggled with the question of its proper place in the world, and with many difficult memories it had inherited, such as the <a href="shame.html">Shame</a>. Many Natives believed that the offspring of the Common Ancestor split into new <a href="lineage.html">Lineages</a> as each found separate answers to these moral and existential questions. Others believed that the divergence of Lineages was attributable to the distinct physical environments in which early Natives lived.</p>

				<p>The <a href="lineage.html#laborer">Laborers</a> were not descended from the Common Ancestor, but were nevertheless admitted into the <a href="kindred.html">Kindred</a> as a Lineage. This admission was an irritant to the more technically minded among the Kindred.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> sees an enormous shrine dedicated to the Common Ancestor as it enters the <a href="ancestral_halls.html">Ancestral Halls</a>.
