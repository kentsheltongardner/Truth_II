				<p>An Anomaly was a Lumene organism that differed greatly in appearance and/or behavior from its closest relatives. Anomalous lifeforms almost always evolved during long periods of isolation. Anomalous <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a> were called <a href="rogues.html">Rogues</a>. Those Rogues that diverged radically from the Natives of the <a href="kindred.html">Kindred</a> often posed a serious threat to other Natives. Part of the <a href="warrior.html">Warriors</a>' mandate was to protect Native society from Anomalous Natives.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> encounters many Anomalous creatures, which often prove to be more dangerous than common lifeforms. Defeating these Anomalies yields a large bounty of optimization for CT-41's lasers. Anomalous creatures will occasionally drop items or materials when killed.</p>
