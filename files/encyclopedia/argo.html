				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Argo was a interstellar colonial landing vessel built by the <a href="united_colonial_administration.html">United Colonial Administration</a>. It touched down on <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>, on the eastern edge of the <a href="fortuna_crater.html">Fortuna Crater</a>, on #DATE <a href="universal_standard_time.html">UST</a>. The Argo traveled through interstellar space atop an enormous antimatter rocket, called the <a href="interstellar_propulsion_system.html">Interstellar Propulsion System</a>. When the ISPS acheived orbit around Lumen 2, the Argo detached, and the command crew and science leads began looking for an appropriate landing site.</p>

				<p>The Argo was cylindrical with a flat top. Its hull was aluminum painted white, with the slogan "All systems Argo!" and the black profile of an ancient Greek galley stenciled onto the exterior. The Argo had large downward telescoping landing legs that leveled the vessel on its landing surface. Two long, sturdy ramps folded down from the Argo's sides to the vessels's east and west after landing, allowing for the offloading of equipment and personnel. A wide tube housing a personnel elevator ran down the center of the vessel, connecting the Argo's decks. This elevator was accessible from all areas of the Argo except the Engine Compartment and the Water Tank.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> spends the first formative hours of its life aboard the Argo after being assembled and activated by <a href="jessica_arai.html">Jessica Arai</a>. It moves between the various decks, talking to and receiving gifts from the crew of the Farsight Expedition.</p>

				<p>When CT-41 is awakened from sleep mode, it finds the Argo worn, its paint faded by the elements, and some of its surface covered in small Lumene organisms.</p>

				<p>After being confined to the Argo by <a href="jusuf_manigault.html">Jusuf Manigault</a>, CT-41 discovers Jessica in the previously inaccessible upper Hibernation Deck. After CT-41 defrosts Jessica, she hears his story and decides to remove CT-41's <a href="shenzen_protocol.html#behavioral_control_unit">Behavioral Control Unit</a>. With its BCU removed, CT-41 is able to disregard Manigault's <a href="override_order.html">Override Order</a> to remain on the Argo.</p>

				<p>When CT-41 returns from the <a href="mountainside.html">Mountainside</a> after speaking to <a href="farsight_crew.html#vadim_kozlov">Vadim</a>, it finds the Argo completely stripped of paint and battered by the elements. By this time, the Argo has passed through four states of being, from pristine to dilapidated: CT-41's birth to sleep mode, sleep mode to the Sea crossing, Sea crossing to climbing the Mountainside, and return from the Mountainside to <a href="truth.html#truth_iii">Truth III</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Decks</div>

				<p>The following were the Argo's decks, beginning from the bottom of the landing craft and moving upward.</p>

				<a id="propulsion_compartment"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Propulsion Compartment</div>
				<p>The Propulsion Compartment allowed the crew access to the Argo's landing rockets, fuel and oxidizer tanks. The rockets were used exclusively for atmospheric landing. During <a href="cobbs_mutiny.html">Cobb's Mutiny</a>, two <a href="marine.html">Marines</a> pulled up floor panels from the <a href="cargo_hold">Cargo Hold</a> and took shelter in the Propulsion Compartment after <a href="karl_westfahl.html">Karl Westfahl</a> opened the cargo doors.</p>

				<a id="cargo_hold"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Cargo Hold</div>
				<p>The Cargo Hold contained disassembled pieces of rovers, excavation equipment, solar panels, machining equipment, Temporary Residential Inflatable Modules (TRIMs), and other large items bolted to the floors and walls. The Cargo Hold was taller than all decks other than the <a href="water_tank">Water Tank</a>. After talking to <a href="william_garrett.html">Captain Garrett</a> and receiving its first mission, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> met <a href="otis_cobb.html">Otis Cobb</a> in the Cargo Hold. By the time CT-41 was wakened from sleep mode and began its explorations of Lumen 2, the Cargo Hold was nearly empty.</p>

				<a id="provisions_deck"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Provisions Deck</div>
				<p>The Provisions Deck contained non-perishable food, clothing, small tools, and equipment. The standard nutrient powder, nicknamed 'sludge', were stored in here. All items on the Provisions Deck were stored in crates, tubs or barrels. The <a href="caretaker.html">Caretaker</a> Colonial Assistant kits were stowed on the Provisions Deck, and it was there that <a href="jessica_arai.html">Jessica Arai</a> assembled CT-41.</p>

				<a id="refrigeration_deck"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Refrigeration Deck</div>
				<p>The Refrigeration Deck contained frozen perishable foods, seeds, embryos, blood and organs.</p>

				<a id="hybernation_decks"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Hybernation Decks</div>
				<p>The Hybernation Decks contained stacked rows of stasis-pods, each housing an <a href="farsight_expedition.html">Expedition</a> member, a civilian colonist, or an animal. Near the end of Cobb's Mutiny, Jessica Arai hid in <a href="cryostasis.html">Cryostasis</a> on one of the Hybernation Decks, avoiding the notice of the <a href="fragment.html">Fragment</a> borne by Cobb.</p>

				<a id="sanitation_deck"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Sanitation Deck</div>
				<p>The Sanitation Deck contained toilets, urinals, mirrors, showers, and stores of hygienic supplies.</p>

				<a id="medical_deck"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Medical Deck</div>
				<p>The Medical Deck contained <a href="ines_orozco.html">Dr. Orozco's</a> office, two gurneys, several hospital beds, an operating table, and various pieces of diagnostic equipment. CT-41 spoke with Dr. Orozco on the Medical Deck soon after landing on Lumen 2.</p>

				<a id="reactor_deck"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Reactor Deck</div>
				<p>The Reactor Deck housed antimatter isolation units, an antimatter reaction chamber, wiring and water tubing, dynamos, battery backup systems, and various computer interfaces and displays. Shortly after landing on Lumen 2, CT-41 met <a href="vadim_kozlov.html">Vadim Kozlov</a> on the Reactor Deck.</p>

				<a id="observation_deck"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Observation Deck</div>
				<p>The Observation Deck was a clean, uncluttered deck with windows on all sides. From the windows Expedition members could look out at the surface and skies of Lumen 2 from a great height. Shortly after being assembled, CT-41 spoke with exobiologist <a href="nicholas_ormeil.html"> Ormeil</a> on the Observation Deck.</p>

				<a id="command_deck"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Command Deck</div>
				<p>The Command Deck housed numerous displays, computer work stations, communications and sensory equipment, and a circular table surrounded by chairs, with a large holographic display in the center. CT-41 met with <a href="kiaan_sood.html">Kiaan Sood</a>, Karl Westfahl, and Captain William Garrett on the Command Deck, and received its first mission there.</p>

				<a id="water_tank"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Water Tank</div>
				<p>At the top of the Argo was a large Water Tank, from which pressurized water flowed to all other decks. The tank could only be accessed from the top of the Argo.</p>
