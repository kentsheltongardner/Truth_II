				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Badlands were a dry and inhospitable region of the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a> slightly below and to the west of the <a href="caverns.html">Caverns</a>. Just as in the Caverns, some of the more shallow chambers of the Wasteland showed evidence of the <a href="destroyer.html">Destroyers'</a> orbital bombardment of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>.</p>

				<p>Before the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a> the area was sparsely populated by <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a>. In the aftermath of the Destruction, the <a href="lineage.html#explorer">Explorers</a> were banished to the Badlands as part of their <a href="destruction.html#punishment">Punishment</a>, and tasked with managing the <a href="remnant.html">Remnant</a>'s waste. The disgraced Explorers constructed and maintained facilities such as the <a href="#incinerator">Incinerator</a>, the <a href="#recycling_plant">Recycling Plant</a>, the <a href="#atmospheric_control_facility">Atmospheric Control Facility</a>,and numerous <a href="waste_chambers">Waste Chambers</a>.</p>

				<p>To prevent Explorers from violating the terms of the Punishment or leaving to the surface, the <a href="lineage.html#ruler">Rulers</a> placed an <a href="executor.html">Executor</a> and surveilance devices strategically at the Wasteland's access tunnels.</p>

				<a id="atmospheric_control_facility"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Atmospheric Control Facility</div>

				<p>The Atmospheric Control Facility was a large installation built by <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a> in the <a href="badlands.html">Badlands</a>. Located near the <a href="recycling_plant.html">Recycling Plant</a> and the <a href="incinerator.html">Incinerator</a>, the Atmospheric Control Facility helped to maintain a healthy atmospheric balance in the Badlands, and by extension the rest of the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>. The Facility also helped control temperatures in caverns near the surface during the hot and cold portions of the <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html#turn">Turn</a>.</p>

				<p>Hundreds of sensors throughout the <a href="realm.html">Realm</a> fed data into computers in the Atmospheric Control Facility. These computers controlled fans, vents, refrigerant systems, heat exchangers, and other machinery necessary to maintain a healthy living environment for Lumene Natives.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> enters the Atmospheric Control Facility after ascending the <a href="openings.html">Openings</a>, and dislodges the <a href="tumor.html">Tumor</a> that has grown enormous and engorged in the Facility's ductwork. With the Tumor destroyed, new avenues for exploration open up as CT-41 can now enter the air ducts.</p>

				<a id="fossil_site"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Fossil Site</div>

				<p>The Fossil Site is a cavern system below the <a href="#mud_pits">Mud Pits</a>, where many fossilized Lumene lifeforms were immortalized in sediments. Within the Fossil Site were the petrified remains of several <a href="ancient.html">Ancients</a>, including one of the <a href="old_god.html">Old Gods</a>.</p>

				<a id="incinerator"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Incinerator</div>

				<p>The Incinerator was a facility, located near the top of the <a href="#">Badlands</a>, where <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a> of the <a href="remnant.html">Remnant</a> burned wastes that were too difficult to recycle by other means. The Incinerator contained bins into which unburnt materials were sorted, several large furnaces, and ash and smoke filtration and reclamation chambers. The furnaces themselves were connected to the surface of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a> by ventilation ducts. Large fans in these ducts pulled oygen rich air from the surface into the furnaces, accelerating the combustion of waste.</p>

				<p>Prior to the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a>, Natives had disposed of much of their waste from the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a> by asking <a href="lineage.html#explorer">Explorers</a> to move it to designated areas on the surface. After the Destruction, and in keeping with the <a href="ruler.html">Rulers'</a> mandate forbidding a return to the surface, all waste management processes had to occur in the Underground. Thus the Incinerator was constructed in the Wasteland, and the disgraced Explorers were tasked with operating it and all other waste management facilities.</p>

				<p>During the events of Truth II, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> navigates through the Incinerator's furnaces and reclamation systems to its ductwork. After moving through the ductwork and disabling its fans, CT-41 emerges onto the surface of Lumen 2, near the <a href="mountainside.html#foothills">Foothills</a> at the base of the <a href="mountainside.html">Mountainside</a>.</p>

				<a id="listening_post"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Listening Post</div>

				<p>The Listening Post was a bunker, near the surface of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>, built and manned by the solitary <a href="companions.html#stargazer">Stargazer</a>. In the Listening Post the Stargazer received and analyzed data from <a href="probe.html">Probes</a> for many <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html#turn">Turns</a> after the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a>.</p>

				<a id="mud_pits"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Mud Pits</div>

				<p>The Mud Pits were an area at the upper western end of the <a href="#">Badlands</a>, where run-off from the Mountainside accumulated. The Mud Pits were the home to several unique creatures, and were havardous to navigate. Below the Mud Pits was the <a href="Fossil Site.html">Fossil Site</a>, where ancient sediments had solidified into rock, fossilizing the remains of creatures trapped within.</p>

				<a id="recycling_plant"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Recycling Plant</div>

				<p>The Recycling Plant was a large <a href="Lumene Native.html">Native</a> facility in the Wasteland, where waste products from throughout the <a href="Underground.html">Underground</a> were recycled, reclaimed and repurposed. Recycled material was recirculated into the Native material economy either by mandate or by auction.</p>

				<p>Before the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a>, rubbish that could not be economically processed in the Recycling Plant was taken to designated waste areas on the surface. After the Destruction, and owing to limited waste disposal volume in the Underground, recycling processes were redesigned for increased efficiency. Any trash that could possibly be reused was reused, and what remained was compacted in Compacting Tubes and stored in the <a href="Waste Chambers.html">Waste Chambers</a> near the bottom of the Wasteland.</p>

				<a id="salvage_yard"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Salvage Yard</div>

				<p>The Salvage Yard was a large, open facility, east of the Recycling Plant, where materials from the Desolation were brought to be repurposed, disassembled, cut apart or melted down.</p>

				<a id="waste_chambers"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Waste Chambers</div>

				<p>The Waste Chambers were dry and sandy chambers in the <a href="Wasteland.html">Wasteland</a>, considered undesirable for <a href="Lumene Native.html">Native</a> habitation, where the <a href="Remnant.html">Remnant's</a> compacted or hazardous wastes were stored.</p>
