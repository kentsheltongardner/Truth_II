				<p>Enhanced Humans were humans with significant genetic modifications and hardware improvements that provided them with advantages over unmodified humans. The crew of the <a href="paralus.html">Paralus</a> consisted entirely of Enhanced Humans, modified to perform their various roles optimally. In societies consisting primarily of Enhanced Humans it was considered unethical to reproduce naturally, and primitive humans were pitied. Eventually natural reproduction became impossible in Enhanced societies.</p>

				<p>Beginning in #YEAR, genetic enhancement services became available to parents. Genetic engineers developed predictive tools that allowed them to eliminate defects and produce desired genetic traits. Computer algorithms were able to select optimal combinations of parental DNA so that genetically superior zygotes could be assembled and implanted into a mother's uterus. The process eliminated genetic diseases, and due to the widespread availability of genetic services, natural conception was seen as haphazard and irresponsible.</p> 

				<p>As computing power increased and predictive models improved, alterations to the genome became more extreme. Proprietary genetic formulae were discovered to guarantee mental and physical health, sociability, strength and intelligence. Enhanced Humans increasingly held the most prominent roles in society.</p>

				<p>After the invention of the <a href="artificial_womb.html">Artificial Womb</a>, and the decoupling of the human body and reproduction, sexual dimorphism became superfluous. Scientists were able to produce Enhanced Humans unperterbed by unnecessary sexual form and function. Genetic engineers aided by artificial intelligences learned to refocus innate sexual and survival drives toward other objectives, creating humans who received pleasure and long term fulfillment from the completion of preordained roles. For example, a human modified to have an excellent mathematical mind could be calibrated to also have a passion for mathematics. In fact, it was considered immoral to produce Enhanced Humans whose aptitudes differed from their interests.</p>

				<p>Eventually genetic sequences were discovered to produce humans that did not age after reaching adulthood, did not require sleep, and whose minds retained their plasticity forever. The crew of the Paralus consisted of these highly superior Enhanced Humans, who were strong, immortal, driven, devastatingly intelligent, connected to each other through the <a href="network.html">Network</a>, and equipped with <a href="neural_augment.html">Neural Augments</a> and various physical modifications.</p>
