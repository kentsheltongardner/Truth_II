				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Tibal Wars were a series of escalating conflicts betweens the <a href="lineages.html#ancestral_lineage">Ancestral Lineages</a> of the <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a>, in which the <a href="lineage.html#adventurer">Adventurers</a> fought against a coalition of <a href="lineage.html#nurturer">Nurturers</a> and <a href="lineage.html#philosopher">Philosophers</a> which called themselves the '<a href="kindred.html">Kindred</a>'. After nearly a <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html#turn">Turn</a> of raids, skirmishes, sieges and decisive battles, the Kindred was victorious, and pacified the Adventurers.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Background</div>

				<p>For several Turns leading up to the War, lone Adventurers had raided the Nurturers' territory from the the <a href="frontier.html">Frontier</a>, stealing food, livestock and supplies, and occasionally killing Nurturers. As Nurturers began to band together with one another for defense, the Adventurers responded in kind, sending larger, more organized raids against them. Adventurer spies discovered avenues of attack, circumventing Nurturer defenses, and large, aggressive fighters entered Nurturer caverns to pillage.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Wars</div>

				<p>Organized warfare was a new concept for the Natives, who hitherto had operated mostly independent of one another, interacting only when necessary. Combat in the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a> was very different from warfare on land. Natives quickly discovered that engineering and reconnaissance were of utmost importance. Tunneling, collapsing tunnels, and forcing enemies to fight through chokepoints were essential to victory. In the beginning of the Wars <a href="no_mans_land.html">No Man's Land</a> became pitted and scarred by pitfalls and primitive traps.</p>

				<p>After a quarter-Turn of skirmishing and siege warfare in No Man's Land, the militant Adventurers finally gained the upper hand. Their soldiers and scouts led a huge offensive into the <a href="farmland.html">Farmland</a>, and brought many well trained <a href="../creatures.html#hunter">Hunters</a> with them. The Nurturers could not withstand the force that came against them, and were driven west, taking shelter in the distant <a href="refuge.html">Refuge</a>. Those Nurturers that did not escape were either killed, or forced into slavery. The <a href="faithful.html">Faithful</a> held onto their territory in the <a href="deep.html">Deep</a>, but they were isolated in the <a href="enclave.html">Enclave</a> until the very end of the Wars.</p>

				<p>The Philosophers in the <a href="hearth.html">Hearth</a> and the <a href="basin.html">Basin</a> had heard rumor and tales of the Wars, but initially decided not to intervene on behalf of the Nurturers. It was not until the Nurturers were forced to the Refuge that the Philosophers understood the gravity of the situation. The Adventurers were not content to possess the Farmland, and soon began to threaten the areas further to the west, eventually taking the <a href="highway.html">Highway</a> and the <a href="assembly_hall.html">Assembly Hall</a>, and feasting on the <a href="womb.html">Womb</a>'s abundance.</p>

				<p>The Nurturers and Philosophers saw that they could not oppose the Adventurers separately. They formed an alliance, and began to call themselves the 'Kindred'. These new Kinsmen discovered and perfected many hitherto unknown or underdeveloped skills: surgery, triage, combat logistics, and defensive construction. The Philosophers built the <a href="basin.html#fortress">Fortess</a>, and began to fashion weapons and armor superior to the hides and bones used by Adventurers. The Nurturers constructed medical facilities, and began to cultivate strange western crops. Together the Kindred dug tunnels through the Deep that connected the Hearth, the Basin, and the Refuge.</p>

				<p>But far more essential to the Kindred's war effort were their tempermental changes. The Nurturers and Philosophers became capable of aggression, daring, and guile. Even with their superior technology, they could not have defeated the Adventurers without resolve and brutal cunning. Soon the Adventurers gave the Kindred cause to feel hate, and to risk offensive warfare.</p>

				<p>After the Adventurers took the Womb, their advance came to a halt, and both factions were caught in a stalemate. The Adventurers were unable to dislodge their enemies from their strongholds, and the Kindred feared to engage their foes in the open. The Advanturers, hoping to goad the Nurturers into rash combat, began to kill and eat certain of their Nurturer slaves. They then left the remains at the entrance to the Refuge and taunted the Nurturers, calling them weak and cowardly for allowing their Kinsmen to be eaten.</p>

				<p>The Nurturers, enraged by these barbaric acts, were eager to strike back immediately, but the Philosophers urged them to channel their hatred toward a calculated end. The Kindred took council on how they might dislodge the Adventurers from the Highway and the Assembly Hall, and conceived of a plan: A large force of Nurturers would leave the Refuge, and quietly move upward, away from the Adventurers. They would cross the <a href="sea.html">Sea</a>, and descend unexpectedly onto the Highway, which was a natural bottleneck. There they could prevent Adventurer reinforcements from moving west. At the same time, a heavily armed force of Philosophers would emerge from the Basin and take the Assembly Hall.</p>

				<p>The plan succeeded. The Adventurers west of the Farmlands were caught unawares, and were cut off from their brethren. Trapped between the well-equipped and numerous armies of the Kindred, the Adventurers did not even consider surrender, and were annihilated. A large portion of the Adventurer population died in the Assembly Hall and on the Highway.</p>

				<p>After this victory, the Kindred began to slowly dislodge the Adventurers from their other conquered territories. Eventually the aggressors were forced back into the Frontier, where they waged an excrutiating defensive war. By now the Kindred greatly outnumbered the starving and desparate Adventurers, but were still unable to break through No Man's Land, or break through the barricade that protected the <a href="frontier.html#arena">Arena</a>. It was technology that finally tipped the scales in the Kindred's favor.</p>

				<p>In the last battle of the Wars, Philosopher sappers brought their first explosives to bear against the Adventurers' western barricade, and blew it apart in an instant. The bewildered Adventurers that stood guard at the entrance to the Arena were quickly killed as the Kindred poured in. The soldiers fought desparately, but were slowly forced to retreat. The survivors rallied to their <a href="frontier.html#treasury">Treasury</a>, where they were determined to make their last stand. The scouts fled upward toward the <a href="division.html#emptiness">Emptiness</a>, sensing the futility of any further warfare.</p>

				<p>The Kindred had fought against suicidal Adventurers before, and knew that they would only be able to eradicate them at the cost of many lives. Certain Philosopher suggested that they should be spared. These Philosophers beckoned for a courageous representative to emerge, to learn the language of the Kindred and settle a peace. The proud Adventurers were confused by this act of mercy, at first believing it to be a ploy, but eventually one their leaders came out into the open, and met with the Kindred on the Arena floor. There he agreed to meet in a <a href="great_council.html">Great Council</a>, which would be held shortly in the Assembly Hall. He took news of this new development to his brethren, and to the Explorers hiding in the <a href="division.html#shallows">Shallows</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Aftermath</div>

				<p>The leaders of the Kindred presided at this first Great Council, in which they heard argument and passed judgment. Representatives of all the Ancestral Lineages were present. The Council lasted for nearly two terrestrial years. During that time <a href="standard_lumene.html">Standard Lumene</a> was created, and a truce was brokered that forbade all future tribal aggression. No reparations were exacted from the Adventurers, but those Adventurers who had eaten their Kinsmen were denied the <a href="right_of_continuation.html">Right of Continuation</a>.</p>

				<p>The Adventurers were welcomed into the Kindred, and the attributes and names of the six <a href="lineage.html#high_lineage">High Lineages</a> were formalized, according to how each had distinguished itself during the Wars. Nurturers became <a href="lineage.html#farmer">Farmers</a> and <a href="lineage.html#healer">Healers</a>, Philosophers became <a href="lineage.html#engineer">Engineers</a> and <a href="lineage.html#ruler">Rulers</a>, and Adventurers became <a href="lineage.html#warrior">Warriors</a> and <a href="lineage.html#explorer">Explorers</a>. Once they were named, the <a href="locus.html">Locus</a>, or lineal territory, of each Lineage was argued and established.</p>

				<p>The Farmers remained in the Farmland, while the Healers relocated permanently to the Refuge. The Engineers remained in the Hearth, where their sciences advanced rapidly due to discoveries made during the Wars. The Rulers settled in the Basin, and from there charted the course of the Kindred's development. The Warriors lived in the Frontier, and mastered their impulse to conquer. The Explorers did not wish for a Locus, and instead chose to spend their days in solitary exploration of the unknown.

				<p>Forever after the conflict the Warriors felt a deep indebtedness to the Rulers, and became their most loyal vassals. They served by protecting the Underground from dangerous creatures and <a href="rogue.html">Rogues</a>, and by enforcing the Rulers' mandates. No Man's Land was left undisturbed after the Wars, as an eternal testament to their brutality.</p>
