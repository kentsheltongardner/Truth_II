				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>Cave Sickness was the name given by <a href="mine.html">Mine</a> workers to a variety of symptoms suffered while in the crust of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a> beneath the <a href="fortuna_crater.html">Fortuna Crater</a>. These symptoms included headaches, dizziness, nausea, hallucination and memory loss.</p>

				<p>Shortly after boring the main shaft of the Mine, <a href="otis_cobb.html">Otis Cobb</a> and others began to feel headaches while working in the deeper shafts. The effects of Cave Sickness became less painful but more insidious as time went on and the Mine deepened. <a href="ines_orozco.html">Doctor Orozco</a> was not able to determine Cave Sickness' root cause, and instead recommended a reduction in shift length to combat its effects.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Cause</div>

				<p>Cave Sickness was the result of <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme's</a> attempts to <a href="synchronization.html">Synchronize</a> with humans, at great distance, before fully understanding the human nervous system. These first experimental, long distance attempts at influence resulted in mental static and pain for those affected.</p>

				<p>As Thosmodeme's experience grew and humans drew closer to him he was able to Synchronize and influence them more effectively, with fewer side effects. In fact, in the depths of the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>, Cave Sickness gave way to pleasing dopaminergic manipulation. Cobb was the first human to recover from Cave Sickness, as Thosmodeme learned to emulate his mind and inject thought smoothly.</p>

				<p>Humans on the surface of Lumen 2 or sheltered from Thosmodeme by the <a href="uraninite_vein.html">Uraninite Vein</a> never suffered anything more than mild Cave Sickness.</p>
