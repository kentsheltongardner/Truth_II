				<p>Embodied Artificial General Intelligence (EAGI, pronounced 'yoggy'), or embodied intelligence comparable to that of a human, was considered to be the holy grail of robotics during the 21st century. The consensus among academic roboticists was that embodiment, in some form, was essential to the development of human-like intelligence, and that the development of thought was dependendent on physical particulars.</p>

				<p>Pragmatists and businessmen understood the importance and profitability of a general intelligence capable of performing labor. Many corporations pursued the goal of producing an EAGI, among them the <a href="yamato_robotics.html">Yamato-Ruach Robotics Corporation</a>.</p>

				<p>In spite of widespread efforts to tackle the problem of producing an EAGI, progress was initially slow. Difficulties such as size and power constraints, and the relatively slow speed of artificial learning in the physical world, were significant barriers to development.</p>

				<p>However, by #DATE, distributed learning methods, highly accurate physics simulators, advances in neuroscience, and novel neuronal manufacturing techniques led to the production of the first primitive EAGIs. Soon thereafter refinement of production methods resulted in a flood of EAGIs available for commercial, industrial and military applications. The availability of EAGIs like the <a href="caretaker.html">Caretaker</a> ultimately helped to ease the pain of the <a href="gentle_death.html">Gentle Death</a>.</p>

				<p>In response to ethical and existential concerns raised by the rapid emergence of EAGIs, the <a href="shenzen_protocol.html">Shenzen Protocol</a> was produced, and ratified by the UN General Assembly in #YEAR <a href="universal_standard_time.html">UST</a>.</p>
