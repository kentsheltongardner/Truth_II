				<p>The Chain of Memory was a <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Native's</a> continuous record of thought and experience, gifted from parent to child, reaching back to the <a href="primordion.html">Primordion</a> in the <a href="age.html#aquatic">Aquatic Age</a>.</p>

				<p>Lumene Natives and many other lifeforms on <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a> had the ability to store memory in a complete and vivid manner within their liquid crystal <a href="seed.html">Seeds</a>. Natives were born when the cloned Seed of a child began to form in the neural tissues of its parent. During gestation, this Seed received a complete copy of the parent's <a href="lumene_minds.html">minds</a> and memories. Only after birth did a Native's mind and memory begin to diverge from its parent, and add unique links to its Chain of Memory.</p>

				<p>Native <a href="lineage.html#healer">Healers</a> learned to ease mental distress by moving troubled Natives into positive, formative areas of the Chain of Memory, using a therapeutic technique called <a href="regression_treatment.html">Regression Treatment</a>. The patient was encouraged to live life as if from that previous moment, allowing his Chain of Memory to begin branching in a new direction. In cases where the Chain of Memory was damaged, such as was the case for the <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider's</a> parent, this treatment was ineffective.</p>
				
				<p>All Lumene Natives shared a large percentage of the Chain of Memory in common, and were able to revert to ancient modes of communication even though modern speech diverged. The Natives also shared many formative experiences, including the <a href="shame.html">Shame</a>. Natives often spent increasing amounts of time reminiscing in the Chain as they grew older, and their bodies became less capable.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, the <a href="commentary.html">Commentary</a> teaches much of the history of Lumen 2 to <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> by calling upon the ancient links of his Chain of Memory.</p>
