				<p>The Magma Chambers were magma filled <a href="lumene.html">Lumene</a> caverns on the underside of the Lumene crust. They were formed through the ages by natural geological processes, and by the burrowing of <a href="magma_morm.html">Magma Worms</a> and their young. The complex of Magma Chambers beneath the <a href="womb.html">Womb</a> was formed in the <a href="age.html#aquatic">Aquatic Age, when a Magma Worm Ancient smashed into the porous Lumene crust. Low viscosity magma from the <a href="upper_mantle.html">Upper Mantle</a> flowed into the cracks and crevices it opened, and flooded several existing caverns. These magma filled caverns, free of the currents and extreme heat of the Upper Mantle, were ideal incubators for Magma Worm young, who did not yet possess the immense size and thick hides of the adults.</p>

				<p>Both the <a href="geothermal_power_station.html">Geothermal Power Station</a> constructed by the <a href="lineage.html#engineer">Engineers</a> and the <a href="root_fields.html">Root Fields</a> tended by the <a href="farmer.html">Farmers</a> sat atop large Magma Chambers, and tapped into the thermal energy of the Chambers to produce electricity and food.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a> <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> must traverse several Magma Chambers, and requires heavy thermal shielding to do so.</p>
