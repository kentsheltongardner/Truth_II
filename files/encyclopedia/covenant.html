				<p>The Covenant was a sacred promise, made between <a href="voronash.html">Voronash</a> and the <a href="outsider.html">Outsider</a>, to serve and support one another. Much of the Covenant's strength lay in Voronash's immense power and ability to dominate, which he nevertheless did not wield against the Outsider. Voronash promised the Outsider knowledge of <a href="the_real.html">The Real</a> and of <a href="creation.html">Creation</a>, power beyond his ability to comprehend, and an undying and exalted <a href="lineage.html">Lineage</a>, in exchange for <a href="self.html">Selves</a>. The Covenant was the thread that bound Voronash and the Outsider together as master and apprentice.</p>

				<p>Voronash, while held captive in the <a href="pit.html">Pit</a>, reached out twice to the Outsider, offering to Covenant with him. His first offer, extended during the <a href="subjugation.html">Subjugation</a>, was rejected by the Outsider, who sensed its devilish intent. Voronash did not force the issue, and instead waited patiently.</p>

				<p>After the <a href="uprising.html">Uprising</a> and the <a href="slaughter.html">Slaughter</a>, Voronash reached out to the Outsider again. In addition to his previous offers of knowledge, power, and progeny, Voronash promised to destroy <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a>, and assured the Outsider that his hunger would never fall upon him, or his children. The Outsider agreed to aid Voronash, and feed his hunger with Selves. In exchange Voronash gave the Outsider much knowledge, including instructions for reshaping his <a href="seed.html">Seed</a> into the <a href="necrolith.html">Necrolith</a>.</p>

				<p>Voronash eventually fulfilled the terms of his Covenant. He overthrew and devoured Thosmodeme, ending the reign of the Tyrant. He taught the Outsider many things that he could never have learned as a natural child of Creation. He exalted the Outsider and his progeny, and they became potent beings of great power. But in the end, the Devouring Spirit could not be controlled, even by himself. In the <a href="truth_i.html">Truth I</a>, Voronash, in a fit of hunger, began to devour those <a href="lineage.html#angel">Angels</a> that displeased him. The Outsider considered the Covenant broken, and the aging servant abandoned his master, and pondered on his sins, and his penance.</p>

				<!--
				Voronash never broke the covenant, and did not kill the Outsider's children. The devil's in the details.
