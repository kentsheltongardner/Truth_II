				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>Several calendars were used by the various <a href="lineage.html">Lineages</a> of <a href="kindred.html">Kindred</a>. The most common units of calendar time were the Turn, the Life, and the Cycle.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Bathing</div>

				<p>A Bathing began as a colloquial unit of time, roughly equal to the amount of time a <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Native</a> could spend in atmosphere, before having to return to the water for hydration. In the <a href="age.html#enlightened">Enlightened Age</a>, a Bathing was standardized as a fraction of a <a href="#turn">Turn</a>.</p>

			</div>

			<a id="turn"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Turn</div>

				<p>The Turn was a unit of measurement, proposed by Explorers at the inagural Great Council. The Turn corresponded to one Lumene day, or 56 Earth years. <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a> considered the Turn to begin at noontime, when <a href="lumen.html">Lumen</a> was directly above the <a href="fortuna_crater.html">Fortuna Crater</a>. The modern Lumene Calendar began at Turn zero, or the first <a href="lumene.html">Lumene</a> noon after the <a href="unification.html">Unification</a>. Dates before that time were expressed as negative numbers, and dates afterward as positives.</p>

			</div>

			<a id="life"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Life</div>

				<p>The Life was an older unit for measuring time, equal to the length of a Lumene Native's natural lifespan. The Life corresponded to roughly 40,000 Earth years. All Lumene Natives were familiar with this unit of time from birth, having inherited it in the <a href="chain_of_memory.html">Chain of Memory</a>. Although the Turn was universally accepted as the standard unit of measure after the Unification, the Life was still used informally to refer to long periods of time. </p>

			<a id="cycle"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Cycle</div>

				<p>The Cycle was a unit of time used by Lineages that dwelt near the <a href="upper_mantle.html">Upper Mantle</a>, such as the <a href="faithful.html">Faithful</a> and the <a href="worshipper.html">Worshippers</a>. A new Cycle was understood to begin at the time that <a href="magma_worm.html">Magma Worms</a> deposited new young into the <a href="magma_chamber.html">Magma Chambers</a> beneath the Fortuna Crater. These birthings were accompanied by regular, noticeable seismic activity. The Cycle was equal to approximately 40,000 Earth years.</p>
