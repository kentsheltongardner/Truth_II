				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>A Domain was the area over which <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a> or one of his <a href="fragment.html">Fragments</a> was able to exert influence over lesser creatures through <a href="synchronization.html">Synchronization</a>. The scope of a <a href="Singularity.html">Singularity's</a> domain was limited by the Singularity's potency, the number and complexity of the creatures it controlled, surrounding materials and radiation, and the speed of light. Thosmodeme did not allow his Fragments to leave his Domain, fearing that they might turn against him if they became unsynchronized.</p>
				
				<div class="entry-section-title">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> enters the Domains of <a href="fesh_togar.html">Fesh'togar</a>, <a href="fragment.html#uruthmu">Uruthmu</a>, <a href="fragment.html#azeselon">Azeselon</a>, Thosmodeme, and <a href="voronash.html">Voronash</a>, and defeats each. Within these Domains the natural lifeforms have almost all become <a href="servant.html">Servants</a> or <a href="child.html">Children</a> of a Singularity.</p>
