				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>Creation is a finite yet ever growing region within the Real that is claimed by the <a href="creator.html">Creator</a>, and where he enforces his <a href="law.html">Law</a> upon the willing. It is a haven against the incomprehensible terrors and insatiable <a href="singularity.html">Singularities</a> that haunt the <a href="outside.html">Outside</a>. Within Creation time and space expand, and Law protects the freedom and distinctness of all <a href="self.html">Selves</a>. Creation's walls are mighty, and stand firm against those who would destroy it, or enter unbidden.</p>
				
				<p>Before any Self may be admitted into Creation, it must first accept the Creator's Law. Only entities that are willing enter Creation and are made Selves, accepting Creation's responsibilities and enjoying its privileges. Like a Singularity, Creation grows as new entities enter it. However, while Singularities become increasingly dense and ultimately unstable, Creation is a kingdom that expands forever.</p>
				
				<div class="entry-section-title">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> exits and re-enters Creation countless times as it uses the <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider</a>'s <a href="altar.html">Altars</a> to move around Creation to different points in space and time.</p>
