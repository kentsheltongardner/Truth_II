				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Caretaker model automaton was one of the first <a href="embodied_artificial_general_intelligence.html">Embodied Artificial General Intelligences</a>, designed and manufactured by the <a href="yamato_ruach_robotics_corporation.html">Yamato-Ruach Robotics Corporation</a> of Japan. It was a <a href="shenzen_protocol.html">Shenzen</a> compliant automaton, equipped with a <a href="shenzen_protocol.html#behavioral_control_unit">Behavioral Control Unit</a> to detect and halt undesired behaviors. The events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a> centered exclusively around the explorations of a Caretaker, serial number <a href="ct_41.html">CT-CA-00000041</a>, that accompanied the <a href="farsight_expedition.html">Farsight Expedition</a>.</p>

				<p>Though not the first or most popular EAGI available on the market, the Caretaker model was nevertheless highly regarded by industrial professionals for to its rugged build and customizability. Handlers affectionaly referred to Caretakers as 'Toolboxes', due to their clunky shape and their ability to carry and use dozens of seperate tools.</p>

				<p>Due to their reputation for reliablility and durability, the first extra-solar colonial expeditions took specially modified Caretakers with them to assist in colony construction and maintenance. This model was called the Caretaker Colonial Assistant, and fewer than one hundred were ever produced. Several Caretakers accompanied both the <a href="jannah_colony.html">Jannah</a> and <a href="farsight_expedition.html">Farsight</a> colonial expeditions.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, the <a href="united_colonial_administration.html">United Colonial Administration</a> issues a deactivate and disassemble order for all Caretaker automata in its colonies after the <a href="jannah_colony.html#massacre">Jannah Massacre</a>. <a href="jessica_arai.html">Jessica Arai</a> disobeys the order, and puts CT-41 in sleep mode while she investigates the Massacre's cause.</p>
