				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Beast's Den was a large chamber at the base of the <a href="caverns.html">Caverns</a>, where a solitary <a href="beast.html">Beast</a> hoarded food, held hobbled but living prey captive, and maintained its Trophy Pit. The Beast's Den was conected via several tunnels to caverns near the surface where the Beast periodically hunted. The Den contained a small bathing pool where the Beast washed itself.</p>

				<p>After the Beast that inhabited the Den killed <a href="nicholas_ormeil.html">Nicholas Ormeil</a>, it brought his body back to its den and stored it in its Trophy Pit.</p>
				
				<div class="entry-section-title">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> falls into the Beast's Den, directly into its pool, and awakens the Beast. After defeating the Beast, CT-41 finds Ormeil's skull-less skeleton, his <a href="personal_data_recorder.html">PDR</a> and his <a href="rank_card.html">Rank Card</a>. It then leaves the Den and moves into the <a href="desolation.html">Desolation</a>.</p>
