				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Basin, where the <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> <a href="lineage.html#ruler">Rulers</a> lived and worked, was the deepest <a href="locus.html">Locus</a> of the Lumene <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>. It was situated near the <a href="upper_mantle.html">Upper Mantle</a>, west of the <a href="hearth.html">Hearth</a>, and contained various administrative, intelligence, and law enforcement facilities in addition to Native residences.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> gains access to the Rulers' exclusive portion of Basin after defeating the three <a href="fragment.html#greater_fragment">Greater Fragments</a> of <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a>, and moving through the <a href="#factory">Factory</a> and into the <a href="#boiling_lake">Boiling Lake</a>. It is from the Basin that CT-41 is able to move into the <a href="holy_city.html">Holy City</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Areas</div>

				<a id="boiling_lake"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Boiling Lake</div>

				<p>The Boiling Lake was an inhospitable region of the <a href="deep.html">Deep</a>, near the westernmost <a href="magma_chamber.html">Magma Chamber</a>, where drainage from the <a href="sea.html">Sea</a> and the <a href="womb.html">Womb</a> accumulated. Owing to its proximity to the Magma Chamber, the Lake was extremely hot, and its waters were lethal to unprotected <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a>.</p>

				<p>Shortly before the <a href="subjugation.html">Subjugation</a>, and under <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme's</a> direction, Lumene <a href="lineage.html#laborer">Laborers</a> began digging a tunnel from the Boiling Lake to the <a href="lineage.html#ruler">Rulers'</a> <a href="locus.html">Locus</a>. When he deemed that the time was right, Thosmodeme instructed his Laborers to seal and flood the Locus, and destroy the Rulers and <a href="executor.html">Executors</a>. His plan succeeded, and the Rulers were boiled alive in their home.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> passes through the Boiling Lake en route to the Rulers' Locus, taking care to avoid long term exposure to its damaging and corrosive waters, and avoiding the hardy and dangerous lifeforms that had evolved to thrive in it.</p>

				<a id="data_center"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Data Center</div>

				<p>The Data Center was a digital library wherein the <a href="lineage.html#ruler">Rulers</a> housed all records of the <a href="kindred.html">Kindred</a>. At the heart of the Data Center was the <a href="intelligence.html">Intelligence</a>, a powerful mind arising from a web of interconnected <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> <a href="seed.html">Seeds</a>. All <a href="terminal.html">Terminals</a> throughout the <a href="realm.html">Realm</a> were connected directly to the Data Center, allowing point-to-point communication, and access to archival data and the Intelligence.</p>

				<a id="factory"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Factory</div>

				<p>The Factory was a large facility at the eastern end of the Basin, where the majority of the <a href="Remnant.html">Remnant</a>'s material goods were produced. The various production lines in the Factory were supplied with raw materials from the <a href="Mineral Separation Plant.html">Mineral Separation Plant</a> and other sources throughout the Underground.</p>

				<p>Shortly after the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a>, <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> <a href="lineage.html#engineer">Engineers</a> began to renovate a run-down Factory near the <a href="magma_chamber.html">Magma Chambers</a> so that it could serve the Remnant. When their work was finished, the Factory began to produce many different industrial and residential goods, and its output greatly eased the suffering of the Remnant.</p>

				<p>By the end of the <a href="age.html#hidden">Hidden Age</a>, <a href="lineage.html#laborer">Laborers</a> comprised the majority of the Factory's work force. Though the Factory was declared to be a communal property, as a practical matter only a relatively few Rulers and Engineers acted as its owners and administrators.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_II.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> navigates the Factory's production lines, and finds the <a href="../items.html#resonator">Resonator</a>.</p>

				<a id="fortress"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Fortress</div>

				<p>The Fortress was a heavily fortified area at the entrance to the Basin, where <a href="executor.html">Executors</a> were manufactured, assembled, and housed. The Fortress contained surveilance equipment and stationary weaponry, though after the flooding of the Basin much of this machinery became corroded and was no longer functional.</p>

				<p>During the <a href="tribal_wars.html">Tribal Wars</a>, the Fortress was the stronghold of the <a href="lineage.html#nurturer">Nurturers</a> and <a href="lineage.html#philosopher">Philosophers</a>. In it they stored all the provision they could, in preparation for siege. The Fortress and the western gate of the <a href="assembly_hall.html">Assembly Hall</a> were the lines beyond which the <a href="lineage.html#adventurers">Adventurers</a> were never able to advance. The Fortress contains a museum wing, with several well preserved chambers from the time of the Wars. It also features refuges, hideaways and escape routes that were forgotten or never filled in after hostilities ceased.</p>

				<a id="gallery"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Gallery</div>

				<p>The Gallery was an area where the Rulers housed and displayed significant historical artifacts, natural phenomena collected from the Underground, and notable artistic creations. The display pieces included:</p>

				<div class="indented-list">
					<p>An arrangement of skulls, including those of an Old God, a Beast, a Native, and a Pet.</p>
					<p>An Explorer Probe and other spacefaring technologies.</p>
					<p>A painted mural of the distorted surface of Lumen 2 encompassing Lumen, Nox, and the Lumene starscape.</p>
					<p>Primitive Glowstone idols.</p>
					<p>Large and small gemstones on multi-tiered displays.</p>
					<p>Artisticly formed silicate growth specimens.</p>
					<p>Surface rocks, including meteor fragments.</p>
					<p>Anomalous animal specimens, preserved in tanks or cylinders.</p>
					<p>Traditional Native clothing and ancient tools.</p>
					<p>An ornate bas relief map of the Realm, divided into its Loci.</p>
					<p>A large, broken aquarium.</p>
				</div>

				<p>During the Flood, many of the loosely mounted display were destroyed or knocked about. During the events of Truth II, CT-41 finds the Gallery completely flooded and overrun by Lumene organisms. The museum has itself become a relic of historical circumstance.</p>

				<a id="palace"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Palace</div>

				<p>The Palace was a sprawling living area once peopled by the Lumene Rulers, beautified to the best of the Rulers' ability. It contained numerous habitations, and council chambers where Rulers and invited guests discussed Realm politics and law in great depth. During the Flood the Palace was inundated by boiling water, and its inhabitants were killed.</p>

				<a id="vault"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Vault</div>

				<p>The Vault was a high security chamber where Native Rulers stockpiled Material stabilization vials and other valuables.</p>

				<a id="warehouse"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Warehouse</div>

				<p>The Warehouse was a series of chambers, adjacent to the Factory, where the Rulers stockpiled manufactured goods before distribution.</p>
