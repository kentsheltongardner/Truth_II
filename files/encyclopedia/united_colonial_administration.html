				<p>The United Colonial Administration, called 'UCA' or simply 'the Administration', was an international organization, formed in #YEAR, that regulated human colonization of extraterrestrial worlds. At its inception the Administration worked to equitably partition real estate on near-Earth objects, and granted colonization and mineral rights to applicant nations and corporations. It later regulated the colonization of extra-solar worlds.</p>

				<p>With the development of the <a href="rabinowitz_process.html">Rabinowitz Process</a> in #YEAR, and the subsequent availability of antimatter as fuel, manned interstellar travel was brought into the realm of possibiity. In #YEAR the Administration deployed the <a href="large_interstellar_surveyor_telescope.html">Large Interstellar Surveyor Telescope</a> array, and began to exhaustively catalog potentially habitable exoplanets in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way. Soon afterward several proximal Earth-like planets were discovered, and applicants presented offers to the Administration for colonial rights.</p>

				<p>The <a href="jannah_colony.html">Jannah</a> expedition was the first interstellar colonial venture to be approved by the UCA. Shortly afterward several other extra-solar colonial licenses were issued as LIST continued to discover habitable exoplanets. Before the first manned interstellar missions set out, the Administration created the <a href="universal_standard_time.html">UST</a> standard and began its broadcast.</p>

				<p>In #YEAR, after upgrades to the LIST array increased its search radius, scientists discovered artificial patterns on the surfaces of three planets in the <a href="lumen.html">Lumen</a> system. This knowledge was kept classified, and the United Colonial Administration, in cooperation with several large governments on Earth and Mars, began preparations for the <a href="farsight_expedition.html">Farsight Expedition</a>.</p>

				<p>In response to later <a href="Destroyers.html">Destroyer</a> aggression, the Colonial Administration and all its assets were acquired by the <a href="Solar Navy.html">Solar Navy</a> to form the <a href="Interstellar Defense Fleet.html">IDF</a> in #YEAR UST.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, the United Colonial Administration maintains long distance communication with <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> for the first #NUMBER years of its mission. In addition to issuing orders, the UCA sends updates on the status of Earth and the conflict with the Destroyers.</p>
