				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Catacombs were a network of meandering caverns and tunnels in the western <a href="deep.html">Deep</a>, where members of an extinct tribe of primitive <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a> called <a href="worshipper.html">Worshippers</a> entombed themselves. These Natives worshipped the gods of the <a href="mantle.html">Underworld</a>, and buried themselves as near to that warm, eternal realm as possible.</p>

				<p>By the time of the <a href="tribal_wars.html">Tribal Wars</a>, the Catacombs were already ancient beyond reckoning, and unknown to the <a href="kindred.html">Kindred</a>. Of all Natives of the Kindred, only the <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider</a> learned of the Catacombs' existence.</p>

				<p>After the <a href="singularity.html">Singularity</a> entered <a href="creation.html">Creation</a>, it fled from the activity and noise of the Native <a href="locus.html">Loci</a>, and settled in the silent Catacombs to study Creation's <a href="law.html">Law</a> and take shape. There it learned to read and interact with the <a href="seed.html">Seeds</a> of dead Natives in their silent tombs. Due to this formative experience, <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a> and <a href="voronash.html">Voronash</a> were able to perceive and influence the minds of most natural lifeforms.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> takes refuge in the Catacombs as it flees from <a href="voronash.html">Voronash</a> after the battle in the <a href="throneroom.html">Throneroom</a>. Voronash is unable to pursue the much smaller CT-41 through the Catacombs' small and winding tunnels.</p>
