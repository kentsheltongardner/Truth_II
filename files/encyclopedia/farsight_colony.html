				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Farsight Colony was a network of connected chambers dug out of the eastern wall of the <a href="Fortuna Crater.html">Fortuna Crater</a>. It was designed by lead architectural engineer <a href="Otis Cobb.html">Otis Cobb</a> and his engineering staff, with valuable input from <a href="Lois Zhang.html">Lois Zhang</a>, <a href="Vadim Kozlov.html">Vadim Kozlov</a> and other scientists. The Colony was abandoned after <a href="Cobb's Mutiny.html">Cobb's Mutiny</a>.</p>

				<p>When the <a href="Interstellar Propulsion System.html">ISPS</a> arrived in the <a href="Lumen.html">Lumen</a> system, a skeleton command and research crew was brought out of <a href="Cryostasis.html">Cryostasis</a>, and the three planets showing scarring from the <a href="Destruction.html">Destruction</a> were scanned for lifeforms as well as hospitable surface conditions. The command crew and research heads of the <a href="Farsight Expedition.html">Farsight Expedition</a> quickly agreed that life in the system originated on <a href="Lumen 2.html">Lumen 2</a>, and likely spread from there to the other planets.</p>

				<p>Lumen 2 had a rich atmosphere and a molten core, and showed the most signs of previous inhabitation. Detailed scans of the planet showed the scarring on the surface centered around the Fortuna Crater. Absorption spectroscopy of the Crater showed large quantities of meteoric iron in the upper crust, and a large <a href="Uraninite Vein.html">Uraninite Vein</a> further down. Commander <a href="William Garrett.html">William Garrett</a> had the <a href="Argo.html">Argo</a> land on the eastern edge of the Fortuna Crater basin, which at that time was in the shade.</p>

				<p>Shortly after landing, <a href="CT-41.html">CT-41</a> was ordered by Garrett to clear out the primitive but potentially dangerous lifeforms that dotted the eastern floor of the Crater. After the area was secure, one of the Expedition's work crews was brought out of stasis and began setting up temporary shelters. After several weeks surveying and performing geological analysis, and with help from the research staff, Cobb began modeling the Farsight Colony. It would be constructed underground in order to protect the colonists from Lumen's radiation, and from the extreme heat on the surface. A large <a href="Photovoltaics Farm.html">Photovoltaics Farm</a> would be deployed on the <a href="Clifftop.html">Clifftop</a> to supplement the Argo's antimatter reserve until a fission <a href="Reactor.html">Reactor</a> could be assembled.</p>

				<p>Work on the Colony began at the same time as the <a href="Mine.html">Mine</a> so that there would be materials available for its construction. Cobb and his men assembled drilling equpiment on the Crater floor before boring into the cliff face. After reaching the correct depth a vertical shaft for the <a href="Surface Access Elevator.html">Surface Access Elevator</a> was drilled up to the Clifftop. While one crew deployed the Photovoltaics Farm on the Clifftop, Cobb and the other crews were running power lines, and drilling and bracing tunnels underground. The <a href="Garage.html">Garage</a> and <a href="Machine Shop.html">Machine Shop</a> were the first Colony facilities completed.</p>

				<p>After the surface crew had finished deploying the Photovoltaics Farm they assembled the <a href="Transmission Array.html">Transmission Array</a> under the direction of Lieutenant <a href="Karl Westfahl.html">Karl Westfahl</a>. The Marines worked on the Crater's floor constructing the <a href="Barracks.html">Barracks</a> and <a href="Perimeter Fence.html">Perimeter Fence</a> to the west of the Mine and the <a href="Tailings Heap.html">Tailings Heap</a>. Cobb assigned onework crew to work on facilities in the upper levels of the Colony, such as the <a href="Communications Bunker.html">Communications Bunker</a>, the <a href="Water Tank.html">Water Tank</a> and piping systems, and the <a href="Greenhouse.html">Greenhouse</a>. Other crews constructed <a href="Habitation (Human).html">Habitations</a>, produced machinery and building materials in the Machine Shop, and connected the Colony to the Mine via the <a href="Ironworks.html">Ironworks</a>. Kozlov oversaw the construction of the Reactor and the colony's <a href="Battery Racks.html">Battery Racks</a> in the <a href="Power Plant.html">Power Plant</a>.</p>

				<p>During the ISPS's #NUMBER year journey, the <a href="Colonial Administration.html">Colonial Administration</a> had transmitted enormous amounts of data to the Argo, including many of humanity's technological advances. Kozlov and the rest of the research staff busily analyzed the information, and used it to construct advanced tools such as the <a href="../Items/High-Density Battery.html">Ion Matrix</a>. Many pieces of machinery used to complete the Colony were gifts from Earth.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Facilities</div>
				<a id="agricultural_wing"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Agricultural Wing</div>
				
				<p>The Agricultural Wing of the <a href="farsight_colony.html">Farsight Colony</a> was a large subterranean facility where a variety of terrestrial crops and lab grown meats were cultivated.</p>

				<p>The Agricultural Wing contained several high efficiency farming chambers, where ideal conditions for specific crops were maintained. These chambers used computer controlled watering, atmospheric and lighting systems to maximize plant growth and productivity, and many plant crops were harvested each year. The Complex also housed a meat room, where several bioreactors operated, producing different animal muscles and fats.</p>
				
				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> is able to enter the Agricultural Wing, but all crops have long since died, and the bioreactors are no longer operational.</p>

				<a id="barracks"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Barracks</div>
				
				<p>The Barracks was a temperature regulated compound on the <a href="clifftop.html">Clifftop</a> where the <a href="farsight_expedition.html">Farsight Expedition</a> <a href="marine.html">Marines</a> were housed. Its facilities included living quarters, two holding cells, an empty arms locker, environment suit racks, and light vehicle storage.</p>
				
				<p>Operating out of the Barracks, Marines recruited by the <a href="united_colonial_administration.html">UCA</a> spent their days charting unexplored regions of the surface of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>, exploring the <a href="destroyer_wreck.html">Destroyer Wreck</a>, responding to threats posed by Lumene lifeforms, and preserving the peace among the colonists.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> passes through the Barracks after opening the <a href="hangar.html">Hangar</a>.</p>

				<a id="communications_bunker"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Communications Bunker</div>
				
				<p>The Communications Bunker was a room in the <a href="Farsight Colony.html">Farsight Colony</a> from which the <a href="Transmission Array.html">Transmission Array</a> was controlled, and where written, audio and video messages from Earth could be analyzed. Located near the surface of the <a href="Clifftop.html">Clifftop</a>, the Communications Bunker was filled with audiovisual equipment, displays, projectors, consoles and headphone sets.</p>

				<p>During <a href="Cobb's Mutiny.html">Cobb's Mutiny</a> the Communications Bunker was taken by <a href="Laborer (Human).html">Laborers</a> so that no message from <a href="Lumen 2.html">Lumen 2</a> about the Mutiny could be sent to Earth. Cobb used the intercom system in the Communications Bunker to address the colonists, urging them to free themselves of Earth.</p>

				<p>Much later, during the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, the <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider</a> breaks into the Communications Bunker to send a message to Earth. In this message he masquerades as humanity's ally, and transmits valuable scientific information, including hitherto unimplemented technologies derived from analysis of the <a href="custodian.html">Custodian</a>. After using the Communications Bunker to send his message, the Outsider destroys the Communications Bunker, and waits for <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> to arrive in response to the intrusion.</p>

				<a id="deep_access_elevator"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Deep Access Elevator</div>

				<p>The Deep Access Elevator was the elevator that connected the floors of the <a href="Farsight Colony.html">Farsight Colony's</a> <a href="Secure Wing.html">Secure Wing</a>. An Ensign's <a href="Rank Card.html">Rank Card</a> was required to enter the corridor leading to the Deep Access Elevator. The Deep Access Elevator went all the way down to the <a href="Excavation.html">Excavation</a>, and connected the Colony to the <a href="Altar.html">Altar</a> discovered there.</p>

				<a id="excavation"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Excavation</div>
				
				<p>The Excavation was an area at the base of the <a href="farsight_colony.html">Farsight Colony</a> where the <a href="farsight_expedition.html">Farsight Expedition</a>'s archaeologists laboriously unearthed, examined and catalogued objects from the <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> <a href="frontier.html#upper_ruins">Upper Ruins</a>. Expedition members entered the Excavation via the <a href="#deep_access_elevator">Deep Access Elevator</a> in the <a href="#secure_wing">Secure Wing</a> of the Colony.</p>

				<p>For the most part, the structures and artifacts examined in the excavated area of the Upper Ruins were very old and primitive, and were for the most part buried under rubble or sediment. However, the archaeologists also discovered an <a href="Altar.html">Altar</a> near the Upper Ruins, and asked for <a href="farsight_crew.html#vadim_kozlov">Kozlov</a> to help them analyze it. While conducting powered experiments atop this Altar, Kozlov disappeared.</p>

				<a id="garage"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Garage</div>
				
				<p>The Garage was a large chamber at the <a href="Farsight Colony.html">Farsight Colony's</a> entrance, where vehicles and other large objects were stored and repaired. During the events of Truth II, <a href="CT-41.html">CT-41</a> finds the <a href="../Items/Antimatter Reservoir.html">Antimatter Reservoir</a> in the Garage.</p>

				<a id="habitation_units"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Habitation_Units</div>
				
				<p></p>

				<a id="hangar"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Hangar</div>
				
				<p>The Hangar was a facility in which the <a href="Gyoki Satellite.html">Gyoki Satellite</a> and its booster rocket were assembled by <a href="Jessica Arai.html">Jessica Arai</a> and <a href="Vadim Kozlov.html">Vadim Kozlov</a>. During the events of Truth II, and after gaining the Commander's <a href="Rank Card.html">Rank Card</a>, <a href="CT-41.html">CT-41</a> is able to enter the Hangar and open its doors, allowing it access to the <a href="Clifftop.html">Clifftop</a> for the first time. After opening the Hangar very little debris accumulated there, due to the <a href="Shield.html">Shield</a> overhead.</p>

				<a id="ironworks"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Ironworks</div>
				
				<p>The Ironworks was a facility at the western edge of the <a href="Farsight Colony.html">Farsight Colony</a> that connected to the <a href="Mine.html">Mine</a> via a railed tunnel. In the Ironworks the contents of mine carts from the <a href="Upper Levels.html">Upper Levels</a> were dumped into furnaces for melting. A foundry in the Processing Center produced castings, and steel rollers produced structural steel. The eastern end of the Processing Center connected through a large opening to the <a href="Machine Shop.html">Machine Shop</a>.</p>

				<a id="kozlovs_lab"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Kozlov's Lab</div>
				
				<p>Kozlov's Lab was a large space that <a href="Vadim Kozlov.html">Kozlov</a> bored out in secret behind the closet in his quarters. Kozlov programmed the panel at the back of his closet to respond to his <a href="Rank Card.html">Rank Card</a>. Kozlov's Lab contained equipment of his own design, and was stylistically distinct from the rest of the <a href="Farsight Colony.html">Farsight Colony</a>.</p>

				<p>During the events of Truth II, and after it has the Sood's Lieutenant Commander's Rank Card, CT-41 gains access to individual Habitation Units. CT-41 enters Kozlov's spartan unit, and finds a message inscribed on the wall, which says "To Enter MY Home, Please Enter YOUR Name!" CT-41 finds a terminal in the closet, and types 'CT41' to open the wall that leads to Kozlov's Lab. If CT-41 enters an incorrect password, it is prompted to try again in 10 years.</p>

				<a id="liquid_waste_tanks"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Liquid Waste Tanks</div>
				
				<p>The Liquid Waste Tanks were compartments below the <a href="Farsight Colony.html">Farsight Colony</a> where many human and industrial wastes were disposed of and processed. During the events of <a href="Truth II.html">Truth II</a>, when the <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider</a> destroyed the <a href="Communications Bunker.html">Communications Bunker</a> and activated the Colony's lockdown protocol, <a href="CT-41.html">CT-41</a> was able to enter the Colony via the Waste Tanks.</p>

				<a id="machine_shop"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Machine Shop</div>
				
				<p>The Machine Shop was a facility in the <a href="Farsight Colony.html">Farsight Colony</a>, beneath the <a href="Garage.html">Garage</a> and east of the <a href="Ironworks.html">Ironworks</a>, where the Farsight colonists set up their CNC mills and lathes, in addition to other tools such as saws, stamps, drills and 3D printers. Stock metals from the Ironworks were finished as necessary in the Machine Shop, and the CNC machines and printers were used to make prototypes and complex objects.</p>

				<a id="reactor"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Reactor</div>
				
				<p></p>

				<a id="secure_wing"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Secure Wing</div>
				
				<p>The Secure Wing of the <a href="Farsight Colony.html">Farsight Colony</a> was located further into the <a href="Fortuna Crater.html">Fortuna Crater's</a> wall than the <a href="Common Area.html">Common Area</a>, and only higher ranking <a href="Farsight Expedition.html">Expedition</a> personnel could access its facilities. The Secure Wing was located past the <a href="Surface Access Elevator.html">Surface Access Elevator</a>, and instead centered around the <a href="Deep Access Elevator.html">Deep Access Elevator</a>, which branched off into the <a href="Power Plant.html">Power Plant</a>, the <a href="Morgue.html">Morgue</a>, the <a href="Excavation.html">Excavation</a>, and <a href="Kozlov's Lab.html">Kozlov's Lab</a>.</p>

				<a id="surface_access_elevator"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Surface Access Elevator</div>

				<p>The Surface Access Elevator was a lift that connected all the levels of the <a href="Farsight Colony.html">Farsight Colony's</a> <a href="Common Area.html">Common Area</a>, and terminated in a small housing on the <a href="Clifftop.html">Clifftop</a>. After the Farsight colonist's were taken to the <a href="Sanctuary.html">Sanctuary</a>, sediments built up around the housing at the top, causing the doors to malfunction and blocking access to the surface.</p>

				<a id="artifact_storage"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Artifact Storage</div>
				
				<p>The Artifact Storage was a large warehouse excavated near the base of the <a href="farsight_colony.html">Farsight Colony</a> by human work crews. It was constructed to house <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Native</a> and <a href="destroyer.html">Destroyer</a> wreckage and artifacts recovered from the surface and <a href="underground.html">Underground</a> of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a> by members of the <a href="farsight_expedition.html">Farsight Expedition</a>.</p>

				<p>After arriving on Lumen 2, the scientific crew of the Farsight Expedition, with help from the <a href="marine.html">Marines</a>, set about charting the local surface of the planet. During their expeditions, mapping crews occasionally found wreckage, both of Native surface dwellings, and of Lumene and Destroyer spacecraft. Though the crews never discovered evidence of extant intelligent life, <a href="william_garrett.html">Captain Garrett</a> and the Expedition's science leads considered the recovered artifacts to be of inestimable value. As the number of recovered items grew, Garrett ordered the construction of a high security Artifact Storage to house them.</p>

				<p>In addition to surface debris, the Expedition's archeaological team also unearthed various ancient tools and decorative items from the <a href="upper_ruins.html">Upper Ruins</a>. These were also catalogued and stored in the Artifact Storage.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> finds the <a href="../items.html#constant_rotor">Constant Rotor</a> in the Artifact Storage after taking <a href="otis_cobb.html">Otis Cobb's</a> <a href="rank_card.html">Rank Card</a> from the <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider</a>.</p>
