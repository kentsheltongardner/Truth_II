				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Wild was an expansive region of the Lumene <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>, east of the <a href="frontier.html">Frontier</a>, that was never permanently settled by <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a>. Before the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a> <a href="lineage.html#explorer">Explorers</a> ventured into the Wild to discover its secrets, and <a href="lineage.html#warrior">Warriors</a> fought the <a href="beast.html">Beasts</a> and <a href="rogue.html">Rogues</a> that dwelt there. Deep within the Wild, in a cavern with no name, slept <a href="old_god.html#chemosh">Chemosh</a>, one of the <a href="old_god.html">Old Gods</a>.</p>

				<p>By its nature, the Wild was very different from the <a href="realm.html">Realm</a>, and was not divided into sections based on their function. Only a few of the passageways and caverns in the Wild were charted by Lumene Natives. The Wild was also in a constant state of flux, as Beasts and other creatures routinely created and destroyed tunnels and nests.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Beasthome</div>

				<p>Beasthome was the name given by the <a href="lineage.html#warrior">Warriors</a> to the caverns in the <a href="wild.html">Wild</a> where <a href="beast.html">Beasts</a> occasionally gathered to roar, slam them selves against cavern walls, crush rocks, and kill each other.</p>
				
				<p>After the <a href="pre_tribal_extinction.html">Pre-Tribal Extinction</a>, Beasts and <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a> vied for supremacy in the power vaccuum left by the vanished <a href="ancient.html">Ancients</a>. The Beasts were strong, but lacked the Natives' intelligence, and were eventually displaced from the fertile regions near the <a href="womb.html">Womb</a>. They lived in the Wild, and dug new tunnels to the east in search of new prey.</p>

				<p>When prey grew scarce during the Lumene night and day, all Beasts gathered to the Beasthome, to release their pent up rage. Their hunger, their hatred of the Natives, and their unsatisfied impulse to kill prey resulted an orgy of violence. In the Beasthome the gathered Beasts attacked each other indiscriminately, and the weakest Beasts were killed and eaten. When the weak were culled from the population, and the strong were fed, the Beasts dispersed, each returning to his nest or solitary den. There the Beasts would reproduce, and send their young to live in the now vacant territories of the dead.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> passes through the Beasthome as it makes it way toward the resting place of the <a href="old_god.html">Old God</a> <a href="old_god.html#chemosh">Chemosh</a>. In a bone pit near the Beasthome CT-41 finds a <a href="lineage.html#warrior">Warrior</a>'s <a href="../items.html#scattershot">Scattershot</a>.</p>

				<a id="cave_in"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Cave-in</div>

				<p>The Cave-in was an isolated group of caverns beneath the <a href="hunting_grounds.html">Hunting Grounds</a>, where a band of <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene</a> <a href="lineage.html#warrior">Warriors</a> and <a href="lineage.html#explorer">Explorers</a> became trapped during the <a href="tribal_wars.html">Tribal Wars</a>.</p>

				<p>While attempting to find a new avenue of attack toward the <a href="lineage.html#farmer">Farmers'</a> homeland, the band of <a href="lineage.html#adventurer">Adventurers</a> passed through a wild and geologically unstable region of the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>. Determined to press on in spite of reaching an apparent dead end, members of the group attempted to widen a narrow stone passageway and move through. As they broke the stone, a large portion of the complex collapsed, killing many of the group and sealing the rest in.</p>

				<p>The region isolated by the Cave-in was filled with wild Lumene lifeforms, including several <a href="beast.html">Beasts</a> that congregated near their nest. A period of competition and combat ensued, during which all but one of the Lumene lifeforms trapped in the Cave-In died. The surviving Native leader, called the <a href="companions.html#tribesman">Tribesman</a>, killed the final Beast and ate it before hiding himself and entering <a href="dormancy.html">Dormancy</a>.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> enters the Cave-in by using the <a href="items.html#impulse_cannon">Impulse Cannon</a> to blast apart the massive and ancient stones that sealed it shut. The Tribesman is awakened by the blasts, and waits patiently for the intruder to reveal himself. When the Tribesman does not recongnize CT-41, he attacks, brutally driving CT-41 backward.</p>

				<p>CT-41 defeats the Tribesman, and the <a href="commentary.html">Commentary</a> speaks to the dead Tribesman's <a href="seed.html">Seed</a>. After a brief conversation the Tribesman's empowered Seed joins CT-41, allowing it access to new areas of the Warriors' <a href="locus.html">Locus</a>, and unlocking new <a href="necrolith.html">Necrolith</a> powers.</p>

				<p>If the Caretaker fights the Tribesman and speaks to his Seed in Truth II, the repentant <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider</a> will enter the Cave-in in <a href="truth_iii.html">Truth III</a> and coax the Tribesman out of Dormancy without violence. The Outsider will inform the Tribesman that the Tribal Wars ended long ago, and will tell him the tale of the <a href="destroyers.html">Destroyers</a> and the <a href="destruction.html#sacrifice">Sacrifice</a>. When the Tribesman enters the <a href="realm.html">Realm</a> he will be greeted with rejoicing by the <a href="remnant.html">Remnant</a>, and will return to reclaim his now <a href="sanctification.html">Santified</a> Locus.</p>

				<p>The Warriors will again grow numerous, but will not be indebted and blindly obedient to the <a href="lineage.html#ruler.html">Rulers</a> as they were before. The <a href="executor.html">Executors</a> will be decommissioned, and the Seeds of the Warriors housed within them will be returned to the floor of the <a href="frontier.html#arena">Arena</a>.</p>
