				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Challenger was a large combat robot, created by <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene</a> <a href="lineage.html#engineer">Engineers</a> at the request of the <a href="lineage.html#warrior">Warriors</a>. The Challenger was designed to test a lone Warrior's strength and skill, and had a range of difficulty settings, intended to humble even the mightiest Warrior. At any point during a Warrior's training, he could request to face the Challenger in the <a href="frontier.html#arena">Arena</a>.</p>

				<p>Only Warriors who survived a certain amount of time against the Challenger's final form were presented before the <a href="great_council.html">Great Council</a> as candidates to receive the <a href="right_of_continuation.html">Right of Continuation</a>. A Warrior could yield by leaving the Arena at any time, yet many Warriors, more concerned with victory than life, died fighting the Challenger.</p>
				
				<p>The Challenger had three separate forms. In its first form, the Challenger was stationary, and acted as a defensive turret. In its second form, the Challenger moved rapidly across the floor of the Arena, charging at its foes and knocking them back. In its third form, the Challenger flew, seeking out its opponent wherever it hid.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> activates the Challenger by attacking it. If CT-41 survives one minute against its third form, the Challenger returns to the center of the Arena, and settles back into its first form. The door to the <a href="treasury.html">Treasury</a> then opens when CT-41 approaches. Inside, among other items, are enshrined the statues of all Warriors who have beaten the Challenger. From the Treasury CT-41 is able to navigate toward the <a href="upper_ruins.html">Upper Ruins</a>.</p>

				<p>If CT-41 deals sufficient damage during the minute of the Challenger's final form, it will be destroyed, dropping the #SUPER_COOL_ITEM.</p>
