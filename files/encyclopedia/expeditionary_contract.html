				<p>The Farsight Expeditionary Contract was a lengthy document, prepared by legal experts working for the <a href="united_colonial_administration.html">United Colonial Administration</a>, which was designed to protect the Administration's physical and intellectual assets. The Contract, which was signed by all members of the <a href="farsight_expedition.html">Farsight Expedition</a>, included release of liability agreements, non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements, performance and labor agreements, descendency agreements, and property forfeiture agreements.</p>

				<p>The non-negotiable Farsight Expeditionary Contract was draconian compared to other expeditionary contracts, and required that colonists surrender many of their personal rights and liberties. Several of the more controversial terms of the Contract gave members of the <a href="labor_society.html">Labor Society</a> understandable cause for resentment against Earth and the UCA.</p>
