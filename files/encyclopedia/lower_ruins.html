				<p>The Lower Ruins were an isolated web of <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> dwellings beneath the Refuge and west of the Holy City where the <a href="Worshipper.html">Worshippers</a> lived during the <a href="age.html#tribal.html">Tribal Age</a>. The Lower Ruins were closer to the <a href="underworld.html">Underworld</a> and the main vent of the <a href="volcano.html">Volcano</a> than any other ancient Native ruins.</p>
