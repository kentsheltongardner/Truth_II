				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Faithful were a group of <a href="lineage.html#farmer">Farmers</a> who held off the <a href="lineage.html#adventurer">Adventurers</a> during the <a href="tribal_wars.html">Tribal Wars</a>, and never left the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a> during the <a href="age.html#planetary">Planetary Age</a>. The Faithful chose to isolate themselves in their <a href="farmland.html#enclave">Enclave</a>, but joined their <a href="kindred.html">Kinsmen</a> in fighting <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a> during the <a href="uprising.html">Uprising</a>. After the Kindred's defeat in the <a href="assembly_hall.html">Assembly Hall</a>, the Faithful returned to their Enclave, and killed themselves by drinking unrefined <a href="flow.html">Flow</a> before the <a href="uprising.html#slaughter">Slaughter</a>.</p>

				<p>The Faithful believed in spirits that lived in and vivified the <a href="magma_chamber.html">Magma Chambers</a>. They also venerated the <a href="deep_root.html">Deep Roots</a>' <a href="origin.html">Origin</a>, tending its offshoots in as natural a manner as they could. The Faithful encased their dead in carefully tended Deep Roots, symbolically joining them with the Origin.</p>

				<p>The Faithful preserved the knowledge of Farmers who lived near the <a href="division.html#underworld">Underworld</a> during the <a href="age.html#tribal">Tribal Age</a>. They observed that the temperature of the Magma Chambers and the surrounding caverns would occasionally increase, and that the Deep Roots became correspondingly more fruitful. These changes occured as <a href="magma_worm.html">Magma Worms</a> cyclically visited the Magma Chambers to deposit the seeds of an ecosystem, including their young. The calendar of the Faithful was based on these <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html#cycle">Cycles</a>, rather than on the more modern <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html#turn">Turn</a>.</p>

				<p>Many of the Faithful believed in the divinity of the Underworld and the beings that dwelt there. They considered the seemingly eternal source of life and warmth beneath them to be worthy of adoration, and praised the spirits that dwelt there. During the Uprising, the Faithful were among Thosmodeme's fiercest foes, as they considered him to be a false god and usurper from the beginning.</p>

				<p>The Faithful were a practical, paranoid and superstitious people. They knew that occasionally the Deep Roots they tended would become less productive, as activity in the Magma Chambers ebbed. They remembered the Tribal Wars, and guarded their produce jealously from foes real and imagined. Many believed that one day the Origin would darken and utterly withhold its bounty. As such, the Faithful dug out and filled huge pools with Flow, in preparation for times of scarcity. Ironically, the Faithful killed themselves before they could use their stores, and their heavily protected <a href="farmland.html#flow_caverns">Flow Caverns</a> held vast stores of wasted surplus, untouched for hundreds of Cycles.</p>

				<p>The Faithful knew of #OLD_GOD who slept in the lower western portion of the Enclave, but they did not disturb or speak of him to others, and sealed the passageway to his chamber shut. It was their belief that the <a href="old_god.html">Old Gods</a> should sleep forever.</p>
