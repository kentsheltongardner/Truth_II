				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Companions are seven empowered <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> <a href="seed.html">Seeds</a> that join <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> during its journey of exploration on <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>. They aid CT-41 in various ways, including by translating, allowing access to secure areas within their <a href="locus.html">Loci</a>, granting <a href="vision.html">Visions</a>, and augmenting CT-41's movement, defenses, and attacks. The Companions glow the same color as the <a href="locus.html#locus_door">Locus Doors</a> they are able to open.</p>
				
				<p>All Companions are empowered to act by the <a href="#outsider">Outsider</a>, the first Companion that CT-41 finds. The Outsider has a finite store of energy within his <a href="necrolith.html">Necrolith</a>, indicative of how much of the <a href="singularity.html">Singularity</a> he has trapped within it. This energy is depleted as Companions use their abilities, and slowly regenerates afterward. CT-41 has the option to instruct his Companions to use or abstain from using their powers. A Companion instructed not to use its power glows more dimly than others.</p>

				<p>If CT-41 creates <a href="truth_III.html">Truth III</a> and casts out <a href="voronash.html">Voronash</a>, the information he gained from his Companions will change the course of future events. The Outsider in Truth III will study CT-41's sensory log, and his resultant actions will be shown as dream-like cinematic sequences before the interactive portion of Truth III begins.</p>

				<p>If CT-41 finds all the Companions, they will all advocate on behalf of the Outsider and the <a href="lineage.html#explorer">Explorers</a> in <a href="great_council.html">Great Council</a>. The <a href="destruction.html#punishment">Punishment</a> will be lifted, and the Explorers will regain their status within the Kindred.</p>

			<a id="deliverer"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Deliverer</div>

				<p>The Deliverer was a <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Native</a> <a href="lineage.html#healer">Healer</a> who before the <a href="subjugation.html">Subjugation</a> helped members of the <a href="remnant.html">Remnant</a> cope with or overcome mental disease. He was one of the pioneers of <a href="regression_treatment.html">Regression Treatment</a>, a psychological method centering around reverting a <a href="kindred.html">Kinsman's</a> mind to a prior, stable state. Before the <a href="subjugation.html">Subjugation</a>, the Deliverer tried, and failed, to repair the <a href="chain_of_memory.html">Chain of Memory</a> of the <a href="#outsider">Outsider</a>'s parent.</p>

				<p>During the Subjugation, shortly after the <a href="hollowing.html">Hollowing</a> of the <a href="lineage.html#laborer">Laborers</a>, the Deliverer formulated the <a href="secret_thought.html">Secret Thought</a>, which allowed the <a href="remnant.html">Remnant</a> to break free of <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme's</a> control. After the <a href="uprising.html">Uprising</a> was crushed, the Deliverer was captured along with several other Natives, and held in the <a href="life_support_facility.html">Life Support Facility</a>, where <a href="fragment.html#fesh_togar">Fesh'togar</a> tortured him, hoping to force him to release the Secret Thought.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, and after defeating Fesh'togar, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> finds the shriveled Deliverer, rotting away and deprived of his limbs, suspended in a life support tank. CT-41 is able to communicate with the Deliverer with the Outsider's assistance. The Deliverer insists that CT-41 kill him, and after a brief conversation, CT-41 does so by destroying the life support tank. After a longer conversation, the Deliverer's empowered <a href="seed.html">Seed</a> emerges from its putrefying body, and joins CT-41 as a Companion.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth III</div>

				<p>If CT-41 speaks to the Deliverer in Truth II, the Outsider will reunite with his aging and enfeebled parent in <a href="truth_iii.html">Truth III</a>, and work with the Deliverer to restore his Chain of Memory.</p>

				<p>If CT-41 speaks to the <a href="#stargazer">Stargazer</a> and the Deliverer in Truth II, the Outsider will reunite his healed parent with his old friend in Truth III.</p>
				
			</div>
			<a id="follower"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Follower</div>

				<p>The Follower was a <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Native</a> <a href="lineage.html#laborer">Laborer</a> that tended the Flesh Vats near the end of the Hidden Age. Under the influence of Thosmodeme and his own resentment, he helped to dig the tunnel from the Boiling Lake to the Basin.</p>

				<p>During the Subjugation, the Follower became Hollowed along with the rest of the Laborers. After Thosmodeme released the Hollowed Laborers from his control, the Follower died slowly, unable to move or eat.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> finds the remains of the Follower between two <a href="farmland.html#flesh_vats">Flesh Vats</a>. Though it is difficult to speak to him at first, CT-41 slowly rouses the Follower from his stupor, and works to convince him of Thosmodeme's evil. In spite of all the rhetorical tactics CT-41 uses, it can only convince the Follower to abandon Thosmodeme if it has the <a href="#deliverer">Deliverer</a> among its companions.</p>

				<!--
				"You speak well and rightly, Caretaker, but the Deliverer wishes to speak to this Laborer for a moment, alone."
				-->

				<p>Once the Deliverer speaks to him, the Follower agrees to join CT-41 in its journey. His <a href="seed.html">Seed</a> is empowered by the Outsider, and rises as a new Companion.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth III</div>

				<p>If CT-41 speaks to the Follower in Truth II, the Outsider will offer to help the Laborers build a Locus of their own in <a href="truth_iii.html">Truth III</a>. He will petition the Rulers to allow the Laborers to inhabit and beautify the same region where they constructed the <a href="holy_city.html">Holy City</a> in Truth II.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="groundskeeper"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Groundskeeper</div>

				<p>The Groundskeeper was a <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Native</a> <a href="lineage.html#farmer">Farmer</a> and adherent to the creed of the <a href="faithful.html">Faithful</a>. His ancestors were front-line veterans of the <a href="tribal_wars.html">Tribal Wars</a>, and he carried their memories and independent spirit. The Groundskeeper tended to and read the lights of the <a href="origin.html">Origin</a>, the source of all uncorrupted <a href="deep_root.html">Deep Roots</a> throughout the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>.</p>

				<p>Before the <a href="subjugation.html">Subjugation</a>, as the <a href="presence.html">Presence</a> of <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a> began to infiltrate his mind, the Groundskeeper and all other Faithul killed themselves by drinking poisons distilled from <a href="flow.html">Flow</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> enters the chamber of the Origin, and finds the Groundskeeper's body there. After a brief conversation, the Groundskeeper's empowered <a href="seed.html">Seed</a> agrees to join CT-41 as a Companion.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth III</div>

				<p>If CT-41 speaks to the Groundskeeper in Truth II, the Outsider will reach out to the Faithful and the Groundskeeper specifically in <a href="truth_iii.html">Truth III</a>, asking them for help during the <a href="famine.html">Famine</a>. With food more readily available, the <a href="right_of_continuation.html">Right of Continuation</a> will be granted to more Natives.</p>
				
			</div>
			<a id="linguist"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Linguist</div>

				<p>The Linguist was a <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Native</a> <a href="lineage.html#ruler">Ruler</a> whose ancestors helped to formulate <a href="standard_lumene.html">Standard Lumene</a> during the first <a href="great_council.html">Great Council</a>. In later times he continued to update and perfect the language, to make it as precise, expressive, and efficient as possible.</p>

				<p>During the <a href="age.html#hidden">Hidden Age</a>, the Linguist became less and less interested in the political goings on of the <a href="realm.html">Realm</a>. He spent much of his time in the <a href="basin.html#repository">Repository</a>, studying the <a href="custodian.html">Custodian</a>, a <a href="destroyer.html">Destroyer</a> maintenance construct. After several <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html#turn">Turns</a> of interaction and analysis, he was able to piece together much of the Destroyers' nature and history. It was the Linguist who first discovered that the Destroyers were looking for their makers, the <a href="architect.html">Architects</a>.</p>

				<p>When the Laborers flooded the Basin at <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a>'s behest, the Linguist was killed along with the rest of the Rulers. Due to the protective covering he always wore while interacting with the Custodian, the Linguist survived longer than other Rulers, and his <a href="seed.html">Seed</a> was preserved after his death.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> finds the Linguist in the vertical shaft connecting the Basin and the <a href="refuge.html">Refuge</a>. CT-41 speaks with the Linguist, who chooses to join CT-41 as a Companion.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth III</div>

				<p>If CT-41 speaks to the <a href="#stargazer">Stargazer</a> and the Linguist in Truth II, the Outsider will bring the two <a href="lineage.html#philosopher">Phillosophers</a> together to discuss their separate findings in <a href="truth_iii.html">Truth III</a>. They will speculate that the Architects might be the same beings that the Stargazer saw in his <a href="probe.html">Probe</a> data. They will later convey this information to the crew of the <a href="argo.html">Argo</a> when it arrives on <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>.</p>

			</div>
			<a id="outsider"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Outsider</div>

				<p>The Outsider was a <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Native</a> <a href="lineage.html#explorer">Explorer</a> whose parent worked in the <a href="badlands.html#incinerator">Incinerator</a>. He was the only Explorer known to be born after the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a>, and was birthed in violation of the <a href="destruction.html#punishment">Punishment</a>'s requirements. As Native children inherited much of their parents' mind and memory, under Lumene law the Outsider was considered culpable of its parent's reproductive crime.</p>

				<p>During his childhood and adolescence, the Outsider remained hidden from all Natives other than his parent and a reclusive <a href="lineage.html#engineer">Engineer</a> called the <a href="#stargazer">Stargazer</a>. The Outsider's parent often visited the Stargazer in his <a href="badlands.html#listening_post">Listening Post</a>, and began to bring the Outsider with him soon after his birth. During these visits the Stargazer taught the young and malleable Outsider introductory lessons in the natural sciences and mathematics.</p>

				<p>While his parent worked at the Incinerator, the Outsider kept hidden, and sought out secret places within the <a href="badlands.html">Badlands</a>. During one of his explorations, he came across a <a href="terminal.html">Terminal</a> that had been buried in light rubble during the Destruction. The Outsider worked to repair the Terminal, and soon began using it to communicate anonymously with the other <a href="lineage.html">Lineages</a> of the <a href="remnant.html">Remnant</a>.</p>

				<p>The Outsider felt the greatest closeness with the Engineers, and learned much from them as he debated physics and presented novel interpretations of their experiments. With time he impressed them so much that they asked him to join them in the <a href="hearth.html">Hearth</a>. When he explained that he was an Explorer and could not leave his <a href="locus.html">Locus</a>, the Engineers advocated for him before the <a href="lineage.html#ruler">Rulers</a>, who granted him a reprieve.</p>

				<p>The grown Outsider emerged from the Badlands, and was welcomed by his friends in the Hearth. During his stay with the Engineers, he worked primarily with the <a href="hearth.html#accelerator">Accelerator</a>, producing new forms of exotic matter as he attempted to divine the fundamental nature of existence. The Outsider's success was such that certain Engineers became envious, and questioned his age.</p>

				<p>As soon as the Outsider learned that the Rulers had ordered <a href="lineage.html#healer">Healers</a> to test his age, he fled from the <a href="realm.html">Realm</a>. Looking bar far into his <a href="chain_of_memory.html">Chain of Memory</a>, the Outsider remembered a labyrinth of nearly impassable caverns above the <a href="sea.html">Sea</a>. As far as he knew, the passage through these caverns was known only to him and his ancestors. He fled from the Realm, and took shelter in the area beyond the <a href="razor_caverns.html">Razor Caverns</a>. He called this region the <a href="nucleus.html">Nucleus</a>, and made it his <a href="locus.html">Locus</a>.</p>

				<p>Within the Nucleus the Outsider constructed his home, the <a href="nucleus.html#laboratory">Laboratory</a>. Over several <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html#turn">Turns</a> he used his practical scientific skills to construct a reactor powered by fuel extracted from the <a href="nucleus.html#uraninite_vein">Uraninite Vein</a>. As an Explorer, and a trained scientist, his thirst for knowledge was fierce, and he continued to perform experiments as he had with the Engineers, ocasionally leaving his Locus to steal supplies. Sympathetic Engineers would often leave doors unlocked and stores exposed.</p>

				<p>After several Turns of meticulous observation and reasoning he finally proved his two <a href="existential_dilemata.html">Existential Dilemata</a>. The Dilemmata, which described the limits on what can be known, showed the impossibility of understanding an infinite universe, and of fully understanding a finite universe from within. In effect, the Outsider proved the ultimate futility of his own quest for knowledge.</p>

				<p>The Outsider did not despair, however. He decided that if he could not know all truth, he could still know the truths of this universe, by looking at it from <a href="outside.html">Outside</a>. Long he pondered how he might open a window, or a door, to the Outside, and settled on a dark mission. He conjectured that anything that ceases to exist leaves the universe. The <a href="self.html">Self</a> that is at one moment and is gone the next became his study.</p>

				<p>Darkness filled the mind of the Outsider, and he became a necromancer. In his Laboratory he built a sacrificial chamber, whereon he killed creatures he captured throughout the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>, to see what change their deaths effected on <a href="creation.html">Creation</a>. Eventually he became impatient with such victims, and began to birth and kill his own children at a dizzying rate. The Outsider rationalized and dismissed their deaths, positing that it was only really himself that he was killing. In fact, he thought himself a martyr rather than a butcher.</p>

				<p>With time the Outsider's unnatural acts began to fatigue the Walls of Creation. As hosts of Selves were drawn out of the world, the Walls began to weaken. The Outsider built his <a href="prime_altar.html">Prime Altar</a>, and powered it on to stabilize and expand the worn fabric of the universe until it tore. The Outsider acheived what he set out to do, and glimpsed into the Outside.</p>

				<p>But he could not understand what he saw there. <a href="the_real.html">The Real</a> was expansive, chaotic and unintelligible. The Outsider dared not immerse himself fully, and the creatures and <a href="../creatures.html#watcher">Watchers</a> he sent to the Outside did not always return, or sometimes returned greatly changed.</p>

				<p>Though the Outsider was unable to understand the new region he had unlocked, he did learn how to use it. As time and space did not exist in the normal sense outside Creation, the Real could be used as a medium to instantaneously transport matter from one place to another. Outside of Creation, the <a href="law.html">Law</a> that set a universal speed limit and conserved matter and energy did not exist. The Outsider conducted more experiments, and learned to send matter out of one <a href="tear.html">Tear</a> and bring it back immediately at another.</p>

				<p>Once he perfected this technique, the Outsider began to build <a href="altar.html">Altars</a> in secret chambers all throughout the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>. When they were ready, he sent word to the Rulers that he had a great gift for the <a href="kindred.html">Kindred</a>. He revealed the locations of all his lesser Altars to the Rulers, and instructed the in their use. The Rulers and Engineers were astonished, and euphoric.</p>

				<p>The Rulers conferred with the Healers, and proposed that the Outsider be considered the <a href="progenitor.html">Progenitor</a> of a new Lineage. Though the science behind this claim was dubious, the Rulers insisted that he be so named so that their law would not hold him guilty of crime. The Rulers begged the Outsider to return to the Realm, to be honored for his gift.</p>

				<p>The Rulers convened an unscheduled <a href="great_council.html">Great Council</a>, and made several pronouncements. The Outsider was no longer considered an Explorer, but was instead a 'Magician'. The Punishment of the Explorers and the crime of his parent could not be held over him. He would inherit the <a href="lineage.html#warrior">Warriors</a>' <a href="sanctification.html">Sanctified</a> <a href="frontier.html">Frontier</a>, for himself and his posterity. The Outsider was happy.</p>

				<p>Certain Engineers asked their new 'Magician' to look at the <a href="destroyer.html">Destroyer</a> technology they studied. Destroyer <a href="gateway.html">Gateways</a>, and even small constructs like the <a href="custodian.html">Custodian</a>, seemed to rely on gravitic tunnels across space-time to operate. After conductin his own analysis, the Outsider came to the same conclusion about Destroyer technology as the Engineers. Though it was theoretically possible for the Kindred to produce similar tunnels, the energy requirements were literally astronomical. Only with a significant portion of the energy output of a small star could such tunnels be maintained.</p>

				<p>The Engineers also wished to know if the Outsider's Altars operated using the same principle. The Outsider repeatedly assured them that they did not. Though Engineers frequently inquired about the specifics of the Altars' construction and operation, the Outsider declined to answer.</p>

				<p>Soon after the Remnant began to regularly use the Altars, the Outsider noticed a change come over the <a href="lineage.html#laborer">Laborers</a>. They became sporadically willful, eloquent, and perceptive, and began to demand their own Locus. The Healers were convinced that their adopted children were beginning to ascend, but the Rulers were skeptical. The Outsider wondered about the timing of their change.</p>

				<p>Shortly after the Laborers flooded the <a href="basin.html">Basin</a> with boiling water, the Outsider felt a strange <a href="presence.html">Presence</a> take shape in his mind. It sought out his sins, to use against him and weaken his mind. An austere voice came to him, and said: 'Your Shame is greater than all others, Outsider', and he trembled. During the chaos that accompanied the beginning of the <a href="subjugation.html">Subjugation</a>, the Outsider fled to his Laboratory, and he noticed that the Presence no longer came to him. He surmised, correctly, that the dense lode of uraninite that bordered his home also protected him from mental intrusion.</p>

				<p>But the Uraninite Vein was not impenetrable. During the Subjugation, a soft new voice came to the Outsider, claiming to be a captive of the Tyrant. It did not attempt to shame or compel, and instead promised the Outsider many gifts. In return, it asked only that the Outsider come to it at a future date, to feed it when it hungered.</p>

				<p>The Outsider was wary, and asked the voice to leave. The voice respected the request, but before it left it prophesied that the Remnant would be destroyed by the Tyrant. It would then return with the same offer, and the Outsider would not refuse it.</p>

				<p>The Outsider pondered what the voice offered, and waited. The Laborers became <a href="hollowing.html">Hollowed</a>, and <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a> abandoned them to undignified deaths. The Healers cried out as one, and challenged Thosmodeme sufficiently to temporarily break his hold on their minds. During that time the <a href="#deliverer">Deliverer</a> conceived the <a href="secret_thought.html">Secret Thought</a>, and freed the Remnant from Thosmodeme's dominion forever. Through his Watchers the Outsider witnessed much of the <a href="uprising.html">Uprising</a> and the <a href="slaughter.html">Slaughter</a>. Grief-stricken and crippled by guilt, the Outsider entered a <a href="dormancy.html">Dormancy</a> which he expected would last forever.</p>

				<p>During this Dormancy the soft voice of promise returned to the Outsider. It claimed that its prophecy was fulfilled. It again offered the Outcast many gifts of knowledge, of posterity, of immortality and perfection, in exchange for food. It also prophesied that it would after many Turns devour the Tyrant, and ascend to mastery over <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a> and many other worlds. The voice promised to take the Outsider on his journey, in exchange for servitude. Motivated by hope, despair, greed, revenge and self-righteousness, the Outsider agreed.</p>

				<p>It was then that <a href="voronash.html">Voronash</a> began to instruct and corrupt his new acolyte. The Devouring Spirit taught the Outsider how he might alter his <a href="seed.html">Seed</a>, to capture other Selves within its dark corners. The Seed could be even be used to house <a href="singularity.html">Singularities</a> such as the Tyrant and its <a href="fragment.html">Fragments</a>. The Outsider began to stalk the safe areas of the eastern Wild, killing creatures to capture their Selves within his Seed. He began to call it a '<a href="necrolith.html">Necrolith</a>', a stone wherein the dead were housed. Through careful concentration, he learned use the collective strength of his captured will to perform strange miracles.</p>

				<p>As the <a href="age.html#dark">Dark Age</a> lingered on, the Outsider kept himself hidden from Thosmodeme. He and his Watchers witnessed the arrival of the <a href="argo.html">Argo</a> on Lumen 2, and saw the colonists be carried down into the <a href="sanctuary.html">Sanctuary</a>. He watched with great interest as <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> journeyed through the Underground, tirelessly searching for its human creators. He sensed his master's hatred of the robot, but was instructed not to interfere in its journey.</p>

				<p>After CT-41 captured the three <a href="fragment.html#greater_fragment">Greater Fragments</a> of Thosmodeme and weakened the Tyrant in his <a href="holy_city.html#throneroom">Throneroom</a>, Voronash set his age-old plan in motion. With the will of Thosmodeme lessened and directed toward CT-41, Voronash leapt from his <a href="holy_city.html#pit">Pit</a>, slew the <a href="../creatures.html#temple_guard">Temple Guards</a> that watched over him, and devoured the Lesser Fragments they bore. He tore through the crust toward the Throneroom, and just as the Tyrant was about to destroy CT-41, the Devouring Spirit burst from the rear wall.</p>

				<p>Voronash and Thosmodeme battled, much as they had in the <a href="catacombs.html">Catacombs</a> long before, but during this contest Thosmodeme was greatly lessened. His Fragments were gone, and he had exerted himself greatly during his battle with CT-41. Voronash eventually triumphed, and consumed the Tyrant. CT-41 fled toward the Catacombs after discovering it was no match for Voronash.</p>

				<p>The Outsider then received a mission from his master: He was to go the Sanctuary, and kill all humans that lived there. He would capture their Selves in his Necrolith. He would take <a href="otis_cobb.html">Otis Cobb</a>'s <a href="rank_card.html">Rank Card</a> from the <a href="sanctuary.html#tomb_of_the_prophet">Tomb of the Prophet</a> and use it to enter the <a href="farsight_colony.html">Farsight Colony</a>. He would send a message to Earth, and tell those on Earth that he was the only remaining Lumene Native, and hoped to help humanity in its fight against the Destroyers. He would send information about the Natives' theoretical tunnel technology, which humanity would have the means and ingenuity to realize. He would then destroy the <a href="farsight_colony.html#communications_bunker">Communications Bunker</a>, and wait for CT-41 to arrive.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth I</div>

				<p>In <a href="truth_i.html">Truth I</a>, CT-41 found a way into the Communications Bunker despite the Farsight Colony's security lockdown, and found the Outsider waiting for him. The Outsider used its Necrolith to speak to CT-41, and forced a confrontation. Though CT-41 fought bravely, the Outsider disabled it after an intense struggle. The Outsider took CT-41 to its Laboratory, and hung it there as a trophy.</p>

				<p>#NUMBER years after sending its message to Earth, the <a href="paralus.html">Paralus</a> arrived on Lumen 2. The Outsider made contact with Captain <a href="jusuf_manigault.html">Jusuf Manigault</a>, and brought a wealth of Native artifacts and technologies aboard the Paralus. He asked to leave as speedily as possible, to begin working with human scientists to fight the Destroyers. The Paralus' tunnel core powered up, and the vessel sped to Earth.</p>

				<p>Unbeknownst to Manigault and the other crew, Voronash was housed within the Necrolith. When the Paralus arrived at Earth, Voronash emerged and killed the crew, devouring their Selves. He then descended to the surface, and began to exterminate and consume all life on the fertile human homeworld. Using the Paralus, which he called his 'Chariot', Voronash moved to many human worlds, consuming all lives he found there. As his power waxed great, he came closer to acheiving the Perfection he promised he would attain. As the years passed, the Outsider became changed by Voronash, and begat many children whom he called '<a href="lineage.html#angel">Angels</a>'.</p>

				<p>When at last there were no more worlds to scour, the Outsider had grown old and feeble, and was no longer able to birth children. Yet as Voronash had consumed more and more of Creation, his hunger only intensified. The Outsider, who should have long before seen Voronash for what he truly was, was horrified as Voronash began to consume those Angels that displeased him. The Outsider fled from his master's gaze, and returned to his home on Lumen 2.</p>

				<p>The Outsider was now lost completely. He could not oppose Voronash openly, and could bear no more children. His people were dead or dying, and there was no hope in the skies above his world. He returned to his darkened Laboratory, where his reactor had long ago gone offline, and slumped down. As he prepared to let life slip away from him, he felt a voice of truth calling him to the top of the dormant <a href="volcano.html">Volcano</a> west of the <a href="fortuna_crater.html">Fortuna Crater</a>. In his old age he scaled the <a href="mountainside.html">Mountainside</a>, and entered the <a href="hermits_cave.html">Hermit's Cave</a>. There he spoke to <a href="vadim_kozlov.html">Vadim Kozlov</a>, whom he later referred to as the 'True Being'.</p>

				<p>Kozlov said he had been where the Outsider had dared not go, and had been trapped outside Creation in the chaos of the Real. He had seen much, and learned much, and become more than a man. He knew the mind of the Creator, and knew that the <a href="truth.html">Truth</a> he now inhabited was not the <a href="truth.html#eternal_truth">Eternal Truth</a>. He knew the Outsider well, and had seen his many unforgiveable deeds. Yet he also knew that the Outsider had the ability to set the path of Creation straight again. When the Outsider asked how, Kozlov said he must look to his Altars, and then said no more.</p>

				<p>The Outsider descended the Mountainside perplexed. He returned to his Laboratory, and pondered how his Altars might be used to right the course of Creation. As he pondered, he thought that his Altars might be able to move matter from one time to another, as they had moved it from place to place.</p>

				<p>The Outsider spent the last Turns of his life figuring out how to adapt the Altars to travel across time. Since he had not built his Altars for this purpose, the Outsider faced many theoretical and practical difficulties. After he finally succeeded in reconfiguring an Altar, he considered this feat of genius to be the greatest of his life.</p>

				<p>There were two major caveats to traversing time with his Altars, however. An Altar could only carry matter back as far as it had been continuously powered, and a stop could not be triggered in the past. He would be able to travel back to the precise moment the Altar was last powered on, and no other instant.</p>

				<p>The Outsider could not simply use his Prime Altar to travel to a time before Voronash and Thosmodeme, because it had turned off when his reactor went offline. He then looked to his other Altars. Several were still online, and their logs revealed they had been in continuous operation since CT-41 cleared the <a href="hearth.html#geothermal_power_station">Geothermal Power Station</a> of <a href="../creatures.html#vermin">Vermin</a> infestation.</p>

				<p>The Outsider then decided on his next course of action, how he would die, and how he would live on in death. He pulled CT-41 down off his wall, and pored through his sensory logs. The Outsider learned everything he could about the curious automaton, and decided that he would join forces with it to atone for his sins. The Outsider decided on a perfect place to wait for CT-41 in the past, where he would be undisturbed until CT-41 arrived. As death drew close, the Outsider went to the Altar near the <a href="quarry.html">Quarry</a>, modified it for time travel, stepped up onto its shelf, and disappeared into the past.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth II</div>

				<p>In <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, two separate incarnations of the Outsider are in motion. The first lives his life much as the Outsider of Truth I, building the Altars and becoming an acolyte of Voronash. The other, weak and dying, emerges into Truth II on the Altar near the Quarry.</p>

				<p>The living Outsider lures CT-41 to the Communications Bunker, but cannot defeat him, because CT-41 is accompanied by a glowing stone that grants it great power. The beaten Outsider returns to his Laboratory, and Voronash assures him that all is not lost. His message has been sent, and the Chariot will arrive.</p>

				<p>When the Paralus reaches Lumen 2, the Outsider is there to greet Captain Manigault. CT-41 also reports to Manigault, but the Outsider outmaneuvers it, and CT-41 is confined to the Argo. The Outsider brings equipment, data, and Voronash aboard the Paralus, but the Chariot never leaves Lumen 2. CT-41 escapes from the Argo, boards the Paralus, and destroys its tunnel core. With the Paralus now permanently immobilized, Voronash emerges from the Outsider's Necrolith, and chases after CT-41 through the Paralus. CT-41 escapes, and Voronash devours the crew of the Paralus in a rage.</p>

				<p>While CT-41 continues its journey, the Outsider continues to gather food for his master from all across the Underground. He thinks about the stone that accompanies his foe, and considers that it is most likely his own. How this could be he does not know yet, but the irritating thought does not let him rest.</p>

				<p>As life becomes sparse throughout the Underground, the Outsider decides that CT-41's Necrolith must have come from a future time, when he betrays Voronash. The Outsider's resolves to serve Voronash strengthens, and he vows to learn the traitor's secret. He guesses at the possibility of using the Altars to travel back in time. He reveals his plan to Voronash, and they decide that they will return to a younger, greener version of their world, one full of food.</p>

				<p>As the Outsider works to modify his Prime Altar for time travel, CT-41 grows powerful, and invades his Locus. CT-41 navigates the Razor Caverns, and kills many of Voronash's lesser Angels. Voronash enters the Outsider's Seed, to accelerate his thought. Finally CT-41 breaks into the chamber of the Prime Altar. The Outsider is scrambling to modify the Altar, but he simply does not know how. He turns to fight Earth's champion, CT-41.</p>

				<p>Although the Outsider has been changed by Voronash into a radiant and deadly hunter, he cannot defeat CT-41. When this becomes clear, Voronash emerges from the Outsider's Seed, and his dark and immense form fills the chamber. When CT-41 attacks Voronash, the Outsider heals his god with Selves he has in store within his Necrolith. CT-41 focuses his attacks on the Outsider, and kills him. As he is destroyed, his own Self and all others within his Necrolith are released, and consumed by Voronash, who transforms into a being of utter darkness.</p>

				<p>The other Outsider has a very different experience in Truth II. As he moves toward the Explorer's shrine in the <a href="ancestral_halls.html">Ancestral Halls</a>, he senses Thosmodeme's Presence begin to form in his mind. He tries to form the <a href="secret_thought.html">Secret Thought</a> to protect himself, but he has little time, and only knows the Thought from what his Watchers recorded during the Uprising. He passes the <a href="executor.html#bronze_executor">Bronze Executor</a> undisturbed, and climbs up on the Explorer's shrine. There he finally releases his hold on the life of his body, and lets the lights within his Seed go almost completely out. The Presence recedes.</p>

				<p>When CT-41 enters the Explorer's shrine, the Outsider is ready for him. He speaks to CT-41, and convinces it that he is a friend. When he has answered all of CT-41's questions, the Seed of the Outsider rises from his body, and begins to follow CT-41.</p>

				<p>From this point onward the story is CT-41's. The Outsider's Necrolith accompanies it, helping it in any way possible. He opens doors, translates <a href="standard_lumene.html">Standard Lumene</a>, empowers new Companions to join CT-41, and offers <a href="vision.html">Visions</a> of the past. It captures Fragments of Thosmodeme, and gains new powers. When the time comes to fight the Outsider in the Communications Bunker, CT-41 drives the intruder away.</p>

				<p>When CT-41 defeats Voronash, the Devouring Spirit is pulled into the Necrolith. By this point in time Voronash has grown so large that the Ousider has difficulty keeping him contained. He interfaces with his Terminal near the Prime Altar, effecting the changes needed to allow for time travel, and asks CT-41 to step onto the Altar with him. Both CT-41 and the Outsider are carried backward to <a href="truth_iii.html">Truth III</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth III</div>

				<p>In Truth III, the dead Outsider and CT-41 will materialize atop the Prime Altar the instant the young Outsider first turns it on. The living Outsider will be frightened by their sudden appearance, and will cower next to his Terminal. The dead Outsider will speak to him alone, rebuking him for his sins, and forcefully telling him to abandon his evils. He will tell his younger self to destroy the Prime Altar, immediately after sending him and the swollen and cracking Necrolith out of Creation. The dead Outsider will then tell CT-41 to kill the Outsider if he does not destroy the Prime Altar.</p>

				<p>The Necrolith will move to the Altar, and vanish. The Outsider will then initiate an electrical overload of the Prime Altar, resulting in an electrostatic discharge that obliterates the Altar, and damages CT-41's carbon-lattice brain.</p>
				
				<p>As in Truth I, the Outsider will study CT-41's sensory logs, and learn much. He will know when and where CT-41 will arrive on Lumen 2. Depending on CT-41's experiences, the Outsider will be able to improve Lumen 2 in Truth III. In the true tale of his life, the Outsider will use knowledge gained from CT-41 to save himself, his parent, his children, his Lineage, the Kindred, and others beyond his own world.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Rascal</div>

				<p>Rascal was the <a href="#stargazer">Stargazer</a>'s <a href="pet.html">Pet</a>, who lived with him in the <a href="badlands.html#listening_post">Listening Post</a> for many <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html#turn">Turns</a> during the <a href="age.html#hidden">Hidden Age</a>. When the Stargazer died, Rascal had no food but was unwilling to leave his master, and died shortly after.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, the <a href="#outsider">Outsider</a> empowers Rascal's <a href="seed.html">Seed</a>, and it chooses to follow the Stargazer on his new journey.</p>

			<a id="stargazer"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Stargazer</div>

				<p>The Stargazer was a <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Native</a> <a href="lineage.html#engineer">Engineer</a> and one of the principal designers of the <a href="probe.html">Probes</a>. During his work on early Probe prototypes, the Stargazer built a lasting friendship with an <a href="lineage.html#explorer">Explorer</a>. After the Explorers launched the fleet of Probes, the Stargazer and his friend waited paitiently for them to arrive at their destinations, and eagerly recorded and scrutinized the data they began to send back.</p>

				<p>During the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a>, all Native surface facilities were destroyed, including all receivers for the Probes' directed transmissions. While the <a href="remnant.html">Remnant</a> worked to restore the <a href="Realm.html">Realm</a>, the Stargazer left his native <a href="locus.html">Locus</a>, and moved as close to the surface as he safely could to build his <a href="listening_post.html">Listening Post</a>. There he received and analyzed data from the many remaining operational Probes, and learned about the presence of living beings in a distant nebula. During his solitary vigil, he received frequent visits from his Explorer friend, who brought him news of the Realm and rations of food.</p>

				<p>When the Stargazer's friend began to grow old, he produced an offspring. Though this reproduction was in violation of the <a href="lineage.html#ruler">Rulers</a>' law, he frequently brought his child with him to visit the Stargazer. While the child was still young and making sense of the <a href="chain_of_memory.html">Chain of Memory</a>, the Stargazer began to teach him what he could of the natural world. The keen child quickly absorbed all the Stargazer's lessons. He began to communicate with other Engineers, using a hidden <a href="terminal.html">Terminal</a> to access the <a href="connection.html">Connection</a>. The child who would one day be the <a href="#outsider">Outsider</a> grew to maturity, and the Engineers asked him to join them in their Locus.</p>

				<p>Though the Oustider was gone, his aging parent continued to visit the Stargazer, and their sadness was lessened by each other's company. But a time came when the Stargazer's friend no longer came to visit him, or bring him food. The Stargazer neglected to take care of himself, and when he finally became desparate enough to enter <a href="dormancy.html">Dormancy</a>, he didn't have the strength or mineral reserves to do so. He and his <a href="pet.html">Pet</a> <a href="#rascal">Rascal</a> both died in the Listening Post.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> finds the bodies of the Stargazer and Rascal in the Listening Post. They converse, and CT-41 learns of the Stargazer's relation to the Outsider, and hears about the possibility of intelligent nebular life. The Stargazer chooses to join CT-41 in his journey of exploration, and his empowered <a href="seed.html">Seed</a> follows CT-41 as a Companion.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth III</div>

				<p>If CT-41 speaks to the <a href="#linguist">Linguist</a> and the Stargazer in Truth II, the Outsider will bring the two <a href="lineage.html#philosopher">Phillosophers</a> together to discuss their separate findings in <a href="truth_iii.html">Truth III</a>. They will speculate that the <a href="architect.html">Architects</a> might be the same beings that the Stargazer saw in his Probe data. They will later convey this information to the crew of the <a href="argo.html">Argo</a> when it arrives on <a href="lumen_2.html">Luman 2</a>.</p>

				<p>If CT-41 speaks to the <a href="#deliverer">Deliverer</a> and the Stargazer in Truth II, the Outsider will reunite his healed parent with his old friend in Truth III.</p>

			<a id="tribesman"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Tribesman</div>

				<p>The Tribesman was a <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Native</a> <a href="lineage.html#warrior">Warrior</a> who led a reconnaissance and assault force during the Tribal Wars. Late in the Wars he took his Warriors and <a href="lineage.html#explorer">Explorers</a> on a mission to find a flanking avenue of attack into the <a href="farmland.html">Farmland</a>. As his team attempted to widen a tight passage near the base of the <a href="frontier.html#hunting_grounds">Hunting Grounds</a>, a large section of the cave complex they were in came crashing down, killing several Adventurers and trapping the rest near a <a href="beast.html">Beast</a> nest in the <a href="cave_in.html">Cave-in</a>.</p>

				<p>The Tribesman spent a quarter <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html#turn">Turn</a> in the Cave-in with his band, fighting off emboldened Beasts, and searching for prey that grew increasingly scarce. Eventually all of the Natives under the Tribesman's command starved or were killed. The scarred and famished Tribesman remained, however, stalking, killing and eating the last Beasts before finally entering <a href="dormancy.html">Dormancy</a>. He awaited the arrival of any presence that could awaken him, whether an allied search party, or a potential source of food.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, the Tribesman is awakened by <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a>, and attacks the strange and potentially hostile being he sees. CT-41 is trapped, and must kill the Tribesman or be destroyed. After defeating the relentless Warrior, CT-41 speaks to his <a href="seed.html">Seed</a> with the assistance of the Outsider. Although the Tribesman's language is archaic, and his undertanding of the modern world is limited, he quickly agrees to aid CT-41 in its battles, and becomes a Companion.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth III</div>

				<p>If CT-41 speaks to the Tribesman in Truth II, the Outsider will return to the Cave-in in <a href="truth_iii.html">Truth III</a>, and awaken the Tribesman as a friend and ally. The extinct Lineage of the Warrior will be restored, and return to live in the <a href="frontier.html">Frontier</a>. The <a href="executor.html">Executors</a> will be decommissioned, and the <a href="lineage.html#ruler">Rulers</a> will return the Seeds within them to the Arena floor.</p>
