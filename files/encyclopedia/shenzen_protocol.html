				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Shenzen Protocol was a document defining acceptable behavioral standards for robotic automata. Produced over several years by an international assembly of computer scientists, roboticists, ethicists, and intellectuals from other disciplines, it was reviewed, ratified and universally adopted by the UN general assembly in #YEAR. It included definitions for acceptable behaviors by robotic automata, and mandates for behavioral overrides in cases where non-compliant intentions or actions were detected.</p>

				<p>Robotic automata that were not Shenzen compliant were considered illegal, and were required to be deactivated and disassembled. Heavy penalties were levied against organizations and individuals that produced non-compliant automata, or who attempted to tamper with compliance code or hardware.</p>

				<p>Due to the opaque nature of many neural net systems, the Shenzen Protocol mandated that an extra level of programming, intelligible to humans, be layered on top of an automaton's neural net. Before any output in the form of speech or action could be performed by the automaton, the output had to run past a procedurally programmed <a href="#behavioral_control_unit">Behavioral Control Unit</a>, which had power to override the intended action.</p>

				<p>Like most man-made ethical systems, the Shenzen Protocol was not foolproof. In #YEAR <a href="universal_standard_time.html">UST</a>, several years after the <a href="jannah_colony.html">Jannah Colony</a> was established, one of its <a href="caretaker.html">Caretaker</a> Colonial Assistants went berserk, killing five colonists and destroying a habitation unit. Initial studies concluded that the model was not properly interfaced with its BCU. However, after reveiwing data from the incident, <a href="Jessica Arai.html">Jessica Arai</a> was able to prove that the Caretaker itself did not malfunction, and instead the Shenzen Protocol and BCU themselves allowed for it to be manipulated catastrophically.</p>

				<p>The Behavioral Control Unit, or BCU, was a piece of hardware attached to <a href="embodied_artificial_general_intelligence.html">Embodied Artificial General Intelligences</a>. The BCU parsed output from a EAGI's inscrutable neural net, and was capable of detecting and overriding behavioral instructions from the neural net which were deemed to be Shenzen incompliant. The Shenzen Protocol mandated that all autonomous robotics with opaque neural systems be equipped with an up-to-date BCU.</p>

				<p>Additionally, the BCU was able to control the automaton entirely, forcing it to perform actions as instructed by a designated operator. As non-persons without internal experience, automata were not deemed to possess the same rights as humans. If the BCU ever detected an attempt by the automaton or a third party to alter or remove the BCU, it would deactivate the automaton.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a>'s BCU is used on several ocassions to override its preferred course of action and to enforce <a href="override_order.html">Override Orders</a>. After <a href="jusuf_manigault.html">Jusuf Manigault</a> confines CT-41 to the <a href="argo.html">Argo</a>, <a href="jessica_arai.html">Jessica Arai</a> sympathizes with its plight, and performs a successful extraction of its BCU. Now able to ignore direct orders, CT-41 leaves the Argo and prevents the <a href="paralus.html">Paralus</a> from leaving <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a> with <a href="voronash.html">Voronash</a> and the <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider</a> on board.</p>
