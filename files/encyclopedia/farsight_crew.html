				<div class="entry-section-title">Abelino Montes</div>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Overview</div>

				<p>Recruit Abelino Montes was a member of the <a href="farsight_expedition.html">Farsight Expedition</a>'s Work Crew Four. Montes was the first member of the Expedition killed by members of the <a href="labor_society.html">Labor Society</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Background</div>
				
				<p>Originally from Argentina, Montes worked for several African mining operations while in his twenties. Unattached to Earth at age 31, he applied for an extra-solar mining position posted by the <a href="united_colonial_administration.html">United Colonial Administration</a>'s recruitment agency, and made it through the Administration's rigorous selective process due to his work qualifications, excellent physical health, and optimal intelligence and psychological evaluation results.<p>
				
				<p>Throughout the lengthy application and interview process, Montes, like all other Recruits and civilians, received very few details on the Farsight Expedition's destination and mission. Once he was locked into the <a href="expeditionary_contract.html">Expeditionary Contract</a>, he was isolated and comms locked. Administration representatives then provided more information about the mission, such as the possibility of making contact with extraterrestrial life on <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Farsight Expedition</div>
				
				<p>After arriving on Lumen 2, Montes spent the majority of his working hours in the <a href="mine.html">Mine</a>, and was considered by his peers and superiors to be an efficient and dedicated worker. After several months of work, Royce Canosa, one of <a href="#otis_cobb">Otis Cobb's</a> foremen, approached Montes and invited him to join a fraternity called the 'Labor Society'. Though he was interested in joining, Montes was unsure about the strict legality of becoming a <a href="laborer_human.html">Laborer</a>, and consulted Lieutenant Commander <a href="#kiaan_sood">Kiaan Sood</a>.</p>
				
				<p>Sood advised Montes to join the group, and to discretely apprise him of its teachings and activities. At the next opportunity, Montes told his recruiting foreman that he wished to join the society, and was told that he would be initiated at his first assembly. When Montes asked the foreman when and where the assembly would be held, the foreman declined to answer.</p>
				
				<p>Three weeks later, two Laborers came to Montes at the start of his shift, and told him that it was time for assembly, and for his initiation. Montes was escorted to an undocumented chamber in the Mine, and brought to the front of a group of silent Laborers. During the assembly Cobb interrogated Montes in front of the initiated Laborers.</p>
				
				<p>The <a href="fragment.html">Fragment</a> that Cobb carried quickly discerned that Montes intended to inform Sood of the Society's practices and doctrines. Cobb ordered several Laborers to seize Montes, and ordered others to grab stones from the cavern floor. Outnumbered and overpowered, Montes was clubbed to death, and buried at the base of the Mine's <a href="lower_levels.html">Lower Levels</a>.</p>

With Montes' Rank Card CT-41 is able to pass through the <a href="guardhouse.html">Guardhouse</a>, and enter the <a href="ironworks.html">Ironworks</a> and the <a href="machine_shop.html">Machine Shop</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Ines Orozco</div>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Overview</div>

				<p>Ines Orozco was the chief medical officer of the <a href="farsight_expedition.html">Farsight Expedition</a>, and was responsible for the physical and psychological health and well-being of all humans on <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>. Ines Orozco had a forceful personality, and many of her colleagues considered her to be intimidating and self-important.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Background</div>
				
				<p>Ines Maria de las Luces Orozco was born in #YEAR in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and immigrated with her parents to Canada as a child. She excelled in school, and studied space medicine at the Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia. After graduating, Orozco took a job at Lunar Base Alpha as a general practitioner. Her superiors at LBA were impressed with, and sometimes irritated by, her work ethic and intelligence.</p>

				<p>When the <a href="united_colonial_administration.html">United Colonial Administration</a> began to fill positions for research and command leads on the Farsight Expedition, Orozco was at the top of the list of candidates for chief medical officer. In #YEAR Administration officials approached Orozco with an offer to join the Expedition, which she accepted. She immediately began studying the planets in the <a href="lumen.html">Lumen</a> system, the potential harmful effects of <a href="cryostasis.html">Cryostasis</a>, the hazards posed by particles and radiation during interstellar travel, and the medical histories of her fellow expedition members.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Farsight Expedition</div>
				
				<p>After the <a href="interstellar_propulsion_system.html">ISPS</a> arrived at the edge of the Lumen system, Dr. Orozco was the first colonist defrosted and revived. After checking on the status of the crew in their pods, she identified one case of <a href="cryostasis.html#hibernation_rot">Hibernation Rot</a>. Over the next few months she performed several surgeries to remove necrotic flesh from sufferers of milder cases of Rot.</a>

				<p>As the mine shafts were bored and crew of workers moved deeper into the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>, many began to experience <a href="cave_sickness.html">Cave Sickness</a>, which Orozco attempted to diagnose without success. She recommended shortening shifts in the <a href="mine.html">Mine</a> to combat the illness. As <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a> became more familiar with individual humans and humanity generally, the symptoms of Cave Sickness naturally lessened.</p>

				<p>Though most colonists went through several screenings and were in excellent physical and psychological health, Orozco treated the few Expedition members with existing medical conditions, such as <a href="#vadim_kozlov">Vadim Kozlov</a>. She also performed autopsies in the <a href="farsight_colony.html#morgue">Morgue</a> on the few colonists who died and left a body, such as <a href="#kiaan_sood">Kiaan Sood</a> and the woman who died of Hibernation Rot. Orozco took a preventative approach to healthcare, and urged foremen and civilian leaders to implement excercise programs she designed to mitigate postural and work related health risks. She tended to be strict with workers, and condescending toward those she suspected were injured while violating safety protocols.</p>

				<p>In the months leading up to <a href="cobbs_mutiny.html">Cobb's Mutiny</a> Dr. Orozco spoke with several patients who complained of uncharacteristic suicidal ideation, out-of-body experiences, and memory loss. She noted that these episodes tended to happen outside the <a href="farsight_colony.html">Colony</a>, and when the patient was alone. She also sensed a strange, prideful hostility and aloofness from Mine workers, which she was not able to dismiss as simple class tension.</p>

				<p>During Cobb's Mutiny Orozco hid in the kitchen with several other colonists, but was eventually captured by <a href="laborer_human.html">Laborers</a> and herded to the <a href="farsight_colony.html#rec_center.html">Rec Center</a>. After <a href="#otis_cobb">Cobb</a>'s men killed Garrett and the Marines, Orozco was taken with the surviving Colonists to the <a href="sanctuary.html">Sanctuary</a>. During the march to her new home she hid her <a href="personal_data_recorder.html">PDR</a> and Lieutenant's <a href="rank_card.html">Rank Card</a> in the soil of the Lumene Underground. A year after being taken to the Sanctuary, Orozco became Cobb's wife.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth II</div>
				
				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> speaks to Dr. Orozco shortly after it is assembled and activated. She is an attractive woman in her mid-thirties, taller than <a href="#jessica_arai">Jessica</a>, with wavy brown hair. During the course of their conversation, Orozco gives CT-41 a Nanite Coloy, that slowly repairs CT-41 after it takes damage. As CT-41 explores the Underground and discovers Native and Destroyer items, it uses the Nanite Colony to adapt them for its use.</p>

				<p>After CT-41 finds the <a href="../items.html#turbine">Turbine</a> and leaves the <a href="sanctuary.html#hall_of_relics">Hall of Relics</a>, it finds Orozco's PDR and Rank Card in the caverns east of the Sanctuary. With the Lieutenant's Rank Card CT-41 is able to enter the Morgue.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Jessica Arai</div>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Overview</div>

				<p>Jessica Arai was the robotics and AI specialist of the <a href="farsight_expedition.html">Farsight Expedition</a>. She assembled and activated <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> shortly after the <a href="argo.html">Argo</a> landed on <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>, and designed, constructed and repaired mechatronic devices to aid in the construction of the <a href="farsight_colony.html">Farsight Colony</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Background</div>
				
				<p>Jessica was born in Kyoto, Japan in #YEAR. One of relatively few children born in Japan during the <a href="gentle_death.html">Gentle Death</a>, Jessica was fascinated by the robo-dolls her father bought for her when she was young. Growing up it was her dream to create truly intelligent robotics, and she pursued that goal in her studies. She graduated in #YEAR from the Tokyo Institute of Technology with degrees in mechatronics and AI, and was hired immediately by the <a href="yamato_robotics.html">Yamato-Ruach Robotics Corporation</a> during its push to create an <a href="embodied_artificial_general_intelligence.html">Embodied Artificial General Intelligence</a>.</p>

				<p>During her employ with Yamato Robotics Jessica worked on the hardware and neural design of the <a href="caretaker.html">Caretaker</a>, a general purpose automaton. More specifically, Jessica had significant input in the design of the Caretaker's carbon lattice brain. Though not the first EAGI available on the market, the Caretaker model, and especially its industrial variants, were considered to be highly reliable and robust, and Jessica was proud of her involvement.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Farsight Expedition</div>
				
				<p>Jessica was contacted by <a href="colonial_administration.html">Colonial Administration</a> recruiters in #YEAR about joining the Farsight Expedition as its Robotics Specialist. The Administration planned to send several Caretakers on the Expedition, along with an AI <a href="cici.html">Central Computer</a>, and wanted a dedicated and accomplished roboticist to accompany the mission. Jessica was hesitant at first to leave Earth and her parents, but after several weeks of consideration, and with her parents' approval, she agreed to join.</p>

				<p>Upon arriving on Lumen 2, Jessica assembled the first of the Expedition's Caretaker Colonial Assistants, CT-41, and helped it to socialize with the crew before its first mission. When Lieutenant <a href="#karl_westfahl">Westfahl</a> discovered the deactivate and disassemble order for the Caretaker CA model, Jessica was ordered by Commander <a href="#william_garrett">Garrett</a> to comply. Jessica disobeyed, instead leaving the Caretaker in sleep mode while she tried to discover the root cause of the <a href="jannah_colony.html#massacre">Jannah Massacre</a>. CT-41 remained asleep in Jessica's lab until it was awakened by CICI's emergency summons in #YEAR.</p>

				<p>After the Caretakers were declared unsafe, Jessica busied herself with personal projects, in addition to helping build and repair Colony robotics. She first compiled an exhaustive and difficult to follow report on what she believed to be the cause of the Jannah Massacre. After the report failed to persuade Garrett to break protocol and allow the Caretakers to operate, Jessica asked him for resources to work on a mapping satellite, which she named <a href="gyoki_satellite.html">Gyoki</a>. After two years of work she finished the satellite, but the launcher was never completed due to <a href="#vadim_kozlov">Kozlov's</a> disappearance.</p>

				<p>When <a href="#otis_cobb">Otis Cobb</a> and his <a href="laborer_human.html">Laborers</a> stormed the <a href="farsight_colony.html#communications_bunker">Communications Bunker</a>, Jessica was aboard the Argo in her lab while Commander Garrett, Lieutenant Westfahl and several others were in a command meeting. As the <a href="cobbs_mutiny.html">Mutiny</a> progressed Jessica watched video feeds of the Laborers in the Colony along with the rest of the command crew.</p>

				<p>When the Argo was boarded, Garrett insisted that Jessica hide in one of the <a href="cryostasis.html">Cryo Pods</a> on the upper <a href="argo.html#hibernation_decks">Hibernation Deck</a>. She did, and after all the command staff and <a href="marine.html">Marines</a> aboard the Argo were killed or captured, Cobb did not sense her presence.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth II</div>
				
				<p>Jessica Arai was a friendly and helpful young woman. She was short and thin, and had straight black hair reaching down past her shoulders. CT-41's experiences in Truth II begin as Jessica finishes its assembly. She then reveals that she has orchestrated a birthday party for CT-41, and asks CT-41 to go talk to all the members of the crew, to learn about Lumen 2, the Farsight Expedition, and most importantly, to receive presents.</p>

				<p>When CT-41 is confined to the Argo by Captain <a href="jusuf_manigault.html">Jusuf Manigault</a>, it is able to enter the upper Hibernation Deck and awaken Jessica. Due to her extremely long hibernation, Jessica has suffered severe Hibernation Rot and cannot move her legs. Jessica is nevertheless able to talk to CT-41, and learns about its journeys.</p>

				<p>After CT-41 brings her some food, Jessica proceds to extract its <a href="shenzen_protocol.html#behavioral_control_unit">BCU</a> so that it can leave the Argo and prevent the <a href="paralus.html">Paralus</a> from leaving Lumen 2 with <a href="voronash.html">Voronash</a> and the <a href="companion.html#outsider">Outsider</a> on board. After removing the BCU, Jessica lies back down in her Cryo Pod to sleep, and dies shortly thereafter.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Karl Westfahl</div>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Overview</div>

				<p>Lieutenant Karl Westfahl was the communications officer, pulled from the <a href="Colonial Administration.html">Colonial Administration's</a> own ranks, who was assigned to the <a href="Farsight Expedition.html">Farsight Expedition</a>. He was responsible for receiving, reviewing and disseminating all transmissions from the Colonial Administration.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Background</div>
				


				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Farsight Expedition</div>
				
				<p>After the <a href="Interstellar Propulsion System.html">ISPS</a> arrived in the <a href="Lumen.html">Lumen</a> system, Westfahl was brought out of cryostasis and began to process the data transfer backlog, sorting communiques by urgency, and breifing the appropriate parties with relevant information.</p>

				<p>After overseeing the assembly and calibration of the <a href="Transmission Array.html">Transmission Array</a>, Westfahl brought computing and display equipment into the <a href="Communications Bunker.html">Communications Bunker</a>, and awakened his staff to accelerate the enormous task of reading #NUMBER years of updates and orders from Earth. During the events of Truth II, Westfahl searched the message database for information on the <a href="Caretaker.html">Caretaker</a> Colonial Assistant shortly after talking to <a href="CT-41.html">CT-41</a>, and discovered the DND order that the Administration sent in #YEAR. Shortly thereafter he informed Commander <a href="William Garrett.html">Garrett</a>, and the CT-41 was taken offline.</p>

				<p>In the case of contact with intelligent alien life, it was Westfahl's responsibility to work with <a href="Nicholas Ormeil.html">Nicholas Ormeil</a> to determine a suitable physical means of communication with the foreign entity or entities.</p>

				<p>During <a href="Cobb's Mutiny.html">Cobb's Mutiny</a>, after the Colony was lost to the <a href="Laborer (Human).html">Laborers</a>, Westfahl was trapped in the <a href="Argo.html">Argo</a> with Commander Garrett, the command crew, and the <a href="Marine.html">Marines</a>. After a #NUMBER hour standoff, Westfahl secretly contacted <a href="Otis Cobb.html">Cobb</a> and negotiated for his life to be spared. Westfahl opened the doors to the Argo's bulk storage deck, resulting in the deaths of the Marines, Garrett, and the remaining command crew. Cobb, true to his word, spared Westfahl's life, and he descended to the <a href="Sanctuary.html">Sanctuary</a> with the surviving colonists.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth II</div>
				
				<p>Westfahl was a clean-shaven blond man in his late twenties during the events of Truth II. He was irritable and dismissive in his interactions with CT-41, but was respectful toward superiors.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Kiaan Sood</div>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Overview</div>

				<p>Lieutenant Kiaan Sood was the intelligence officer of the <a href="Farsight Expedition.html">Farsight Expedition</a>, and was a <a href="Colonial Administration.html">Colonial Administration</a> liason on <a href="Lumen 2.html">Lumen 2</a>. He sent updates on the <a href="Farsight Colony.html">Farsight Colony's</a> status to Earth, independent of Commander <a href="William Garrett.html">Garrett's</a> own updates, and was broadly tasked with ensuring compliance to the terms of the <a href="Expeditionary Contract.html">Expeditionary Contract</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Background</div>
				
				<p>Kian Sood was born in #YEAR in London, England, into a family of first generation Punjabi immigrants. He was a bright child who excelled in several sports and athletic events. He was accepted into Cambridge in #YEAR, and during his time there converted to Catholic Christianity, with aspirations for the priesthood. He graduated with degrees in Linguistics and International Studies in #YEAR, while simultaneously working through his Jesuit formation.</p>

				<p>Sood was ordained as a Jesuit priest in #YEAR, but during his Tertianship decided that he could do the greatest good in the world by following a different path. He joined the British SIS, and with his people skills, education and physical ability became an operational officer. Very little is known about Sood's work for the SIS other than that he operated extensively in Asia.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Farsight Expedition</div>
				
				<p>In #YEAR Sood was approached by the Colonial Administration, and was offered a unique role on the Farsight Expedition. He would be the Expedition's intelligence officer, observing goings-on in the colony, and looking for subversions of the terms of the Expeditionary Contract. He would be present in all meetings of the senior staff, on the lookout for any departures from protocol. Sood would be given broad latitude to monitor and protect the political health of the Colony, and work to ensure that the culture was in line with Administration aims. Sood accepted the position, and left Sol in #YEAR aboard the <a href="Interstellar Propulsion System.html">ISPS</a>.</p>

				<p>During his time on Lumen 2 Sood organized and presided over a non-denominational Christian assembly every Sunday, and invited non-believers to attend. Sood was an attentive and encouraging listener, and his parishioners and vistors spoke with him freely. Starting on #DATE, Sood noticed <a href="Mine.html">Mine</a> workers in his congregation began to skip assemblies, and he was troubled. After talking to several of the workers Sood was further disturbed by the changes in personality that he noticed.</p>

				<p>Sood had already begun to investigate the possibility of discontent among workers when Recruit <a href="Abelino Montes.html">Abelino Montes</a> asked to speak with him privately. Montes was a Mine worker and regular member of Sood's congregation, and had been asked by his foreman about joining a group called the <a href="Labor Society.html">Labor Society</a>. Montes was concerned that membership might be outlawed by the terms of the Expeditionary Contract, but Sood advised him to join, and to inform him of the Society's practices, statements of belief, and aims. Montes accepted the advice and agreed to report back, but went missing while working in the Mine several days later.</p>

				<p>Sood began to investigate the Mine, comparing Colony inventory to logged material requests made by Mine workers. After finding substantial discrepancies, Sood made his findings known to Commander Garrett, who asked <a href="Otis Cobb.html">Otis Cobb</a> to join him for a private meeting. During the meeting Cobb explained that the loss of equipment was the result of a cave-in, which he had not reported since no workers were injured. He said that it was possible his workers and foremen had been lazy or careless, and circumvented protocol when making material requests. When asked by Garrett about the 'Labor Society', Cobb laughed and said the mention of such a society was probably part of a prank played on Montes by his foreman.</p>

				<p>Garrett, satisfied with Cobb's responses, thanked Cobb for his time, and ordered him to get his foremen and crews running a tighter ship. Garrett also urged Cobb to report all important happenings in the Mine at staff meetings, and to err on the side of providing too much information. Cobb apologized for the irregularities, and promised Garrett that they would be addressed and eliminated immediately.</p>

				<p>Though Garrett was content with Cobb's account, Sood was not, and he attempted to have an operative recruited from the <a href="Agricultural Complex.html">Agricultural Complex</a> transferred to the Mine. Cobb rejected the transfer, saying he didn't need any more help to stay on schedule, and that he didn't want to have to walk any more new workers through <a href="Cave Sickness.html">Cave Sickness</a>. Regardless of these statements, Cobb regularly accepted new workers into the Mines, while progress in the Mine and the Colony had slowed considerably from the impressive pace set during the first #NUMBER years of the Farsight Colony's construction. Cobb claimed this was due to destabilization and flooding issues, which had for safety reasons restricted access to the <a href="Lower Levels.html">Lower Levels</a> of the Mine.</p>

				<p>Continuing his investigation into Cobb and the Mine workers, Sood discovered that for almost two years Mine workers had been falsifying their hours, regularly spending up to sixteen hours a day underground. After asking questions of friends and romantic partners, Sood discovered that occasionally Mine workers would not return to the Colony for days, and would clock out at the end of their shifts but remain in the Mine.</p>

				<p>Determined to figure out what was happening, but unwilling to talk to Garrett without hard evidence of wrongdoing, Sood entered the Mine on #DATE, and ordered the workers restricting access to the Lower Levels to stand aside. When he reached the base of the <a href="Uraninite Vein.html">Uraninite Vein</a>, near the tunnel leading to the <a href="Sanctuary.html">Sanctuary</a>, <a href="Thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a> <a href="Synchronization.html">Synchronized</a> suddenly with Sood, and damaged his mind. Sood returned to his quarters in the Colony, and hanged himself after recording one last log entry in his <a href="Personal Data Recorder.html">PDR</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth II</div>
				
				<p>Kian Sood was a charismatic and persuasive man, with dark skin and a compact, athletic build. He was a curious and attentive listener, and did not talk about himself unnecessarily.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Nicholas Ormeil</div>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Overview</div>

				<p>Nicholas Ormeil was the <a href="Farsight Expedition.html">Farsight Expedition's</a> lead exobiologist, tasked by the <a href="Colonial Administration.html">Colonial Administration</a> with studying and, where applicable, working to communicate with Lumene organisms. He spent much of his time on <a href="Lumen 2.html">Lumen 2</a> exploring the floor of the <a href="Fortuna Crater.html">Fortuna Crater</a>, and the <a href="Caverns.html">Caverns</a> at its western end. He was killed by a <a href="Beast.html">Beast</a> in the Caverns while studying the ecosystem that existed in the Lumene <a href="Underground.html">Underground</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Background</div>
				
				<p>Nicholas Ormeil was an evolutionary biologist, born in #YEAR in Jakarta, Indonesia, who specialized in exobiology. Very little was known about his upbringing or his formal education, and his name was not found on any official registry. In #YEAR, under the name Nicholas Ormeil, he published a groundbreaking allometric treatise online, which grabbed the attention of the greater community of biologists. Shortly thereafter he published a widely acclaimed paper, the confidently titled "On the Desitination of Species", that laid out the first robust predictive model of evolution, along with software demonstrating the validity of the model. An autodidact, he credited his academic successes to his own brand of independent study, and neurostimulants of his own invention.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Farsight Expedition</div>
				
				<p>Ensign Ormeil was a risk taker, and lived for new experiences. When the Colonial Administration offered Ormeil the exobiologist's position on the Farsight Expedition, he immediately accepted. He then asked the administration for access to all the data they had collected on the Lumene planets, so that he could begin to make predictions about what kind of lifeforms they might encounter.</p>

				<p>After arriving on Lumen 2, Ormeil began to cultivate the first terrestrial lifeforms in the Lumene soil and atmosphere. Microorganisms, plants and insects thrived when protected from the oppressive Lumene heat, but even the most hardy thermophiles struggled to survive in the open. Ormeil began his study of Lumene organisms by studying soil samples, and then by collecting small specimens from the surface, many of them <a href="Dormancy.html">dormant</a>. Eventually Ormeil's explorations became more wide ranging, and he received Commander <a href="William Garrett.html">Garrett's</a> permission to enter certain Caverns he had located at the western end of the Fortuna Crater.</p>

				<p>In the Caverns Ormeil discovered a very different living environment than on the surface. Bioluminescent lifeforms dotted the cave walls, and were far more active than life on the surface during daytime. Larger and more diverse organisms appeared as Ormeil moved further into the cave system. Over a period of months, Ormeil examined and collected hundreds of specimens, learning everything he could about Lumene genetic mechanisms.</p>

				<p>Eventually Ormeil glimpsed a Beast, a large predator that occasionally emerged from deeper in the Caverns to hunt. The Beast was frightened by Ormeil, and fled back into the depths. Ormeil set up photo and thermographic equipment to monitor the caverns, and collected thousands of hours of footage, observing the Beast and learning its habits. After several weeks of observation, Ormeil was cornered by the Beast, who in an uncharacteristic display of aggression and intelligence, corralled Ormeil toward one of the chambers where he had recording equipment set up. The Beast killed Ormeil there, and dragged his body lower into the Caverns, toward its bone pit.</p>

				<p>Commander Garrett sent a <a href="Marine.html">Marine</a> fire team to search for Ormeil when he did not report in that night, and they found the footage of Ormeil's death. They returned to chambers closer to the surface to brief Garrett on the situation. He considered it too great a risk to attempt to retrieve Ormeil's body, and ordered the Marines to call off their search. From then on, Garrett indefinitely forbade further exploration of the Caverns.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Otis Cobb</div>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Overview</div>

				<p>Otis Cobb was the American lead architectural engineer of the <a href="Farsight Expedition.html">Farsight Expedition</a>. After becoming a <a href="Vessel.html">Vessel</a> to one of <a href="Thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme's</a> <a href="Lesser Fragment.html">Lesser Fragments</a>, Cobb constructed the <a href="Sanctuary.html">Sanctuary</a>, and orchestrated <a href="Cobb's Mutiny.html">Cobb's Mutiny</a>. He led the Farsight colonists to the Sanctuary, and lived out the rest of his days in peace, subject to Thosmodeme.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Background</div>
				
				<p>Otis Solomon Cobb was born in Mobile, Alabama in #YEAR. He was raised by his highly religious paternal grandmother, Larayna Cobb. Larayna had an exceptional academic mind and a broad education, and provided her grandson with rigorous schooling at home. Cobb grew up during the <a href="Slow Death.html">Slow Death</a>, and watched as Mobile, like many other urban centers, stagnated and fell into disrepair. Living amidst what he saw as the decay of society, Cobb longed for the vital frontier of space. Blessed with a natural talent for and love of the practical sciences, Cobb attended and graduated from Baylor with a degree in geophysics. Shortly thereafter he was hired by Stellar Prospecting Group, to be foreman of a drilling crew in the asteroid belt.</p>

				<p>During his time with Stellar Prospecting Cobb developed novel logistical techniques and drilling equipment, and his reputation for results caught the attention of higher-ups in the <a href="Solar Navy.html">Solar Navy</a>. The Navy contacted Cobb and paid him to study architecture, and afterward for several years Cobb was employed as a Navy contractor. During this time he oversaw the construction of several military installations on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. When the <a href="Colonial Administration.html">Colonial Administration</a> began considering potential candidates for the Farsight Expedition's senior crew, Cobb was the first choice to be the Expedition's lead architectural engineer. When approached for the job, Cobb wholeheartedly accepted.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Farsight Expedition</div>
				
				<p>When the <a href="Interstellar Propulsion System.html">ISPS</a> arrived in the <a href="Lumen.html">Lumen</a> system, Cobb was awakened from <a href="Cryo-Stasis.html">cryo-stasis</a> along with the rest of the command crew and research leads. For two days after waking Cobb experienced a mild case of hibernation narcosis. Though the condition was not serious enough to require medical attention, in his slightly disoriented state Cobb voiced unsettling thoughts to several other members of the crew, including Commander Garrett.</p>

				<p>Once the <a href="Argo.html">Argo</a> moved into orbit around <a href="Lumen 2.html">Lumen 2</a>, Cobb worked closely with <a href="Vadim Kozlov.html">Vadim Kozlov</a> and <a href="Lois Zhang.html">Lois Zhang</a> to identify a suitable landing zone. All three scientists agreed that the eastern edge of the <a href="Fortuna Crater.html">Fortuna Crater</a> offered near ideal conditions for the construction of permanent colonial facilities. Garrett accepted the landing recommendation, and the Argo set down on the crater floor on #DATE.</p>

				<p>Soon after touchdown Cobb got to work, ensuring that all excavation equipment was still in good working order after the long voyage to Lumen 2. When <a href="CT-41.html">CT-41</a> cleared out all potentially hostile lifeforms in the immediate vicintiy of the Argo, work crews 1 and 2 were brought out of stasis. Cobb and his foremen oversaw material removal for the construction of underground colony structures, and the drilling of the main shaft of the <a href="Mine.html">Mine</a>. For the first two years on Lumen 2 construction proceded far ahead of the Colonial Administration's schedule, largely due to Cobb's efficiency, and the steady, ambitious pace he set for himself and his crews. In spite of the rapidity of construction, there were no deaths or major injuries among work crews during this period.</p>

				<p>After the main shaft of the Mine was bored, and exploratory drilling began, Cobb and many laborers who spent time in the Mine began to regularly experience <a href="Cave Sickness.html">Cave Sickness</a>. On #DATE, during an exploratory drilling near the base of the <a href="Uraninite Vein.html">uraninite vein</a>, Cobb experienced a particularly severe bout of cave sickness. He left the drill site in a fugue state, and wandered deep into the crust of Lumen 2, guided through a labyrinth of tunnels as if by a foreign mind. Finally he stood in the <a href="Throneroom.html">Throneroom</a> of Thosmodeme, and was called to be his <a href="Prophet.html">Prophet</a>. He became Vessel to a Lesser Fragment of Thosmodeme, and returned to the <a href="Farsight Colony.html">Farsight Colony</a> three days later a changed man. From that point onward, Cobb operated under Thosmodeme's direction, ultimately taking control of the Farsight Colony and its inhabitants during Cobb's Mutiny.</p>

				<p>After the Mutiny Cobb led the colonists to the Sanctuary, and sealed the way back behind him. He was wed to <a href="Ines Orozco.html">Ines Orozco</a>, who had been promised to him by Thosmodeme, and lived out the remainder of his days as a venerated Prophet.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth II</div>
				
				<p>Otis Cobb was a powerfully built black man of average height, with a strong southern accent. He was in his early forties during the events of Truth II. Cobb modeled his leadership style after that of General George Patton, cultivating and displaying an exaggerated and rowdy persona to entertain and motivate his subordinates. His southern accent was stronger after he left Alabama than when he lived there.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Vadim Kozlov</div>

				<p>Vadim Kozlov was a particle physicist, propulsion expert, and general scientific polymath. He was the first crew member selected for the <a href="Farsight Expedition.html">Farsight Expedition</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Background</div>
				
				<p>Vadim Kozlov was born in northern Ukraine, in a small town on the shore of the Pripyat River in #YEAR. His mother's pregnancy was plagued with complications, and Vadim came into the world suffering from a unique sickness. Later called Kozlov's Syndrome, the condition resulted in improperly regulated growth of certain neural tissues. Throughout his childhood Kozlov was perpetually exhausted, experienced constant headaches, and had extreme difficulty concentrating. He was considered by his father to be a mentally handicapped child and a burden.</p>

				<p> His mother, however, loved Kozlov deeply, and in #YEAR took him to see a medical geneticist, and explore causes and treatments for his condition. After an initial examination, Kozlov was referred to a neurologist, who performed further tests to determine the causes of his pain and fatigue. He prescribed several medications, and formulated a dietary regimen that would help to control Kozlov's debilitating symptoms. After the first three months of treatment, the neurologist observed that Vadim possessed extreme mental plasticity, and was able to absorb and process information at an incredible rate.</p>

				<p>Vadim went on to study mathematics and physics at a local university in Ukraine before he was noticed and recruited by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. At MIT Kozlov studied particle physics and propulsion, and worked with his professors to develop novel high efficiency antimatter reactor and containment systems. After the discovery of the <a href="Rabinowitz Process.html">Rabinowitz Process</a> in #YEAR Kozlov joined Lightyear Propulsion to help with antimatter rocket design. Several years later, after Lightyear had tested its first successful antimatter rocket, Kozlov helped to design the <a href="Ramah al'Amal.html">Ramah al'Amal</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Farsight Expedition</div>
				
				<p>In #YEAR Kozlov was approached by <a href="Colonial Administration.html">Colonial Administration</a> officials who wished for Lightyear Propulsion to design the <a href="Interstellar Propulsion System.html">ISPS</a> for the Farsight Expedition. Kozlov accepted the contract, on the condition that he be a member of the Expedition. The Administration accepted his proposal, and Lightyear's array of antimatter accumulators began producing fuel. Kozlov and his team created blueprints for the ISPS, which was constructed at the <a href="La Diosa Shipyard.html">La Diosa Shipyard</a>. They also collaborated with the Colonial Administration to finalize the design of the <a href="Argo.html">Argo</a>. Kozlov integrated one of his slow burning antimatter reactors into the Argo, which continued operating for several hundred years after its arrival in the <a href="Lumen.html">Lumen</a> system.</p>

				<p>After arriving in the Lumen system and exiting his <a href="Cryo Pod.html">Cryo Pod</a>, Kozlov worked with the Expedition's other science leads to give Commander <a href="William Garrett.html">Garrett</a> recommendations for a landing site. After performing many scans of the Lumene planets, the science team unanimously advised landing in the <a href="Fortuna Crater.html">Fortuna Crater</a> on <a href="Lumen 2.html">Lumen 2</a>. Two weeks after arrival in the Lumen system the Argo touched down on the eastern floor of the Crater. Kozlov immediately got to work designing the <a href="Farsight Colony.html">Farsight Colony's</a> more advanced facilities, such as the <a href="Reactor.html">Reactor</a> and the <a href="Refinery.html">Refinery</a>.</p>

				<p>During his time in the Farsight Colony, Kozlov worked closely with <a href="Ines Orozco.html">Ines Orozco</a> to ensure that his condition did not interfere with his work. She monitored his health constantly, and made adjustments to his diet and medication that improved his health and comfort. Kozlov and Orozco spent a great deal of time together, and became good friends. Kozlov also worked with Specialist <a href="Jessica Arai.html">Jessica Arai</a>, and at the time of his disappearance, Kozlov was building a launch vehicle in the <a href="Hangar.html">Hangar</a> that would have carried Jessica's <a href="Gyoki Satellite.html">Gyoki Satellite</a> into orbit.</p>

				<h2>Disappearance and Fate</h2>
				<p>When the archeaology team discovered the <a href="Altar.html">Altar</a> in the <a href="Excavation.html">Excavation</a>, Kozlov and several of his assistants were asked to study the device. After several weeks of meticulous analysis, the team attached a mobile <a href="../Items/Antimatter Reservoir.html">Antimatter Reservoir</a> to the Altar and began powered experiments. Initially the studies produced no results, and the Altar was seen as an inert, ornamental object. However, on #DATE, Kozlov vanished in front of his co-workers while using a laser measuring tool on top of the Altar. From that point onward Garrett did not allow further powered experiments.</p>

				<p>Kozlov had been thrown out of <a href="Creation.html">Creation</a> by the Altar, and existed for unquantifiable period in the <a href="Outside.html">Outside</a> as a collection of <a href="Entity.html">Entities</a>. Kozlov was able to elude the <a href="Singularity.html">Singularities</a> that hunted him there, and learned much about Creation by interacting with it from outside of space and time. When <a href="CT-41.html">CT-41</a> restored power to the <a href="Underground.html">Underground</a> and the Altars became active, Kozlov reentered creation as a changed being. Sensing the presence of Singularities inside Creation, Kozlov collected several personal items from the empty Farsight Colony, and then went to the <a href="Hermit's Cave.html">Hermit's Cave</a> on the <a href="Mountainside.html">Mountainside</a>, far from the influence of <a href="Thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a> or <a href="Voronash.html">Voronash</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth II</div>
				
				<p>During the events of Truth II, CT-41 visited Kozlov in his Cave after defeating the <a href="Stone Giant.html">Stone Giant</a>. Kozlov gave CT-41 great stores of knowledge, and a weapon called the <a href="../Items/Lawgiver.html">Lawgiver</a>, which proved essential to defeating Voronash and his <a href="Exalted Native.html">Exalted Natives</a>. Kozlov also gave CT-41 his <a href="Rank Card.html">Rank Card</a>, which allowed it to enter his <a href="Kozlov's Lab.html">Lab</a>.</p>

				<p>Vadim Kozlov was a short, balding man with a white beard. He obsessed over his equipment, and was constantly looking for ways to improve the efficiency of operations aboard the Argo and in the Farsight Colony.</p>

				<p>Vadim, as a being who existed outside Creation and who had a special relation with the <a href="Creator.html">Creator</a>, was able to give CT-41 information that no other being possessed, even Voronash. For example, it is through Kozlov that CT-41 learned about the <a href="Destroyers.html">Destroyers'</a> origins and nature.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">William Garrett</div>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Overview</div>

				<p>William Garrett was an officer in the <a href="Solar Navy.html">Solar Navy</a>, and Commander of the <a href="Farsight Expedition.html">Farsight Expedition</a>. He oversaw the construction of the <a href="Farsight Colony.html">Farsight Colony</a> and its facilities, and was responsible for meeting colonial timelines and sending status updates to the <a href="Colonial Administration.html">Colonial Administration</a>. Garrett was killed during <a href="Cobb's Mutiny.html">Cobb's Mutiny</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Background</div>
				
				<p>William Ex Garrett was born on the Ganges colony on Mars, and enlisted in the Solar Navy when he turned 17. He entered officer training school after serving several years aboard an Earth-Moon inspections vessel. He graduated as a pilot, and was sent to guard trade routes in the Asteroid Belt against piracy. Over several years Garrett rose in rank to Lieutenant Commander, and was eventually successful in brokering a peace between the Solar Navy and several pirate coalitions.</p>

				<p>Like many officers in the Solar Navy, Garrett found it difficult to sustain romantic relationships, and was single when approached by the Colonial Administration to be Commander of the Farsight Expedition.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Farsight Expedition</div>
				
				<p>As Commander of the Expedition, Garrett had the final word on top level decisions and the use of Administration resources. He held frequent staff meetings, where command and research leads gave updates on progess and presented findings. Using this information Garrett made executive decisions regarding personnel assignments and allocation of Colony resources, while composing and transmitting weekly status updates to Earth. Garrett also mediated colony disputes, and made himself available to hear any complaints from Administration and civilian colonists. He felt great personal responsibility for the survival and success of the Expedition.</p>

				<p>During Cobb's Mutiny, Garrett led the Expedition's platoon of <a href="Marine.html">Marines</a> against the <a href="Labor Society.html">Labor Society</a>. After several days of fighting, the Marines inficted heavy losses on the Labor Society, but were ultimately overwhelmed due to the <a href="Laborer (Human).html">Laborer's</a> numbers, and <a href="Otis Cobb.html">Cobb's</a> possession of a <a href="Lesser Fragment.html">Lesser Fragment</a>. After defeat in the Colony, Garrett barricaded himself along with several others in the <a href="Argo.html">Argo</a>. He was killed when <a href="Karl Westfahl.html">Karl Westfahl</a> opened the Argo and Cobb's men entered.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth II</div>
				
				<p>Garrett was a tall, bearded white man, with graying hair. He had just turned 40 before the ISPS departed the Solar system.</p>
