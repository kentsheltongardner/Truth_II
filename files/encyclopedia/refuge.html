				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Refuge was an area of the western Lumene <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>, populated in pre-historic times by relatives of the <a href="worshipper.html">Worshippers</a>. To the top and west the Refuge was bordered by the <a href="laccolith.html">Laccolith</a> and the solidified main vent of the <a href="volcano.html">Volcano</a>. It was relatively cool and far from the <a href="womb.html">Womb</a>, and was windier than other areas of the <a href="Realm.html">Realm</a>. The Refuge was dotted with long forgotten ruins, and less populated with simple lifeforms than other regions to the east. From the <a href="age.html#enlightened">Enlightened Age</a> through the <a href="age.html#hidden">Hidden Age</a>, the Refuge was the <a href="locus.html">Locus</a> of the <a href="lineage.html#healer">Healers</a>.</p>

				<p>Early in the <a href="age.html#tribal">Tribal Age</a>, long before the <a href="unification.html">Unification</a>, an enigmatic and secretive population of <a href="lineage.html#philosopher">Philosophers</a> wandered west, and settled in the Refuge. One branch of this mysterious tribe emigrated down and west from the Refuge, and built up a civilization that honored the <a href="magma_worm.html">Gods of the Underworld</a>. The fate of the Worshippers, and of their relatives who settled in the Refuge, was lost to time.</p>

				<p>During the darkest hours of the <a href="tribal_wars.html">Tribal Wars</a>, the <a href="lineage.html#nurturer">Nurturers</a> were pushed out of their homes in the <a href="farmland.html">Farmland</a>. During their retreat they took whatever stores and equipment they could carry, and sought shelter in the Refuge. When the War was won, the <a href="lineage.html#farmer">Farmers</a> returned to and restored the Farmland, but the Healers elected to stay in the Refuge to perfect their craft and develop their own identity. During the first <a href="great_council.html">Great Council</a>, the bounds of the Healers' new Locus were established.</p>

				<p>In the Hidden Age, many <a href="lineage.html#laborer">Laborers</a> congregated near the Refuge, in order to be near the Healers whom they saw as friends and mentors. After <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a> took form within <a href="creation.html">Creation</a>, these Laborers were the first Natives over whom he began to exert dominion.</p>

				<a id="healing_pools"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Healing Pools</div>

				<p>The Healing Pools were spherical chambers, half full of water and lined with stone, that were created by the <a href="lineage.html#healer">Healers</a> at the eastern base of the Refuge. In the Pools exact temperature, lighting, chemical and atmospheric conditions could be produced and maintained. A <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Native</a> might enter a Healing Pool to accelerate post-operation healing, as part of therapy for mental ailments, or simply to relax. The Pools were connected by tubing to the <a href="pumping_station.html">Pumping Station</a> above and to the east.</p>

				<p>Unlike more sensitive areas of the Refuge such as the <a href="#surgical_complex">Surgical Complex</a> or the <a href="#life_support_facility">Life Support Facility</a>, there were no <a href="locus.html#locus_door">Locus Doors</a> that prevented access by non-Healers to the Healing Pools. The Healers considered the Pools to be a public good, even though they were located within the boundaries of their <a href="locus.html">Locus</a>.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> moves through the Healing Pools as it makes its way toward <a href="fragment.html#fesh_togar">Fesh'togar</a> and the <a href="companions.html#deliverer">Deliverer</a>. CT-41 will need to have the <a href="../items.html#turbine">Turbine</a> equipped to make progress through the Pools. After many <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html#turn">Turns</a> of neglect, many of the Pools have become filthy, and some are infested with <a href="servant.html">Servants</a> and lower Lumene lifeforms.</p>

				<a id="life_support_facility"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Life Support Facility</div>

				<p>The Life Support Facility was designed, built, and operated by <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> <a href="lineage.html#healer">Healers</a>, and housed in chambers below the <a href="surgical_complex.html">Surgical Complex</a>. The Facility was originally created to sustain greivously injured Natives during recovery, but the Healers soon discovered that they could also be used to prolong the lives of Lumene Natives and other creatures.</p>

				<p>During the Hidden Age, Healers working in the Life Support Facility began to understand that the identity of a Lumene Native persists within his <a href="Seed.html">Seed</a> even after the death of his body. This discovery led to fevered research by the Healers, <a href="lineage.html#engineer">Engineers</a> and <a href="lineage.html#ruler">Rulers</a>, and culminated in the manufacture of entities such as <a href="executor.html">Executors</a> and the <a href="intelligence.html">Intelligence</a>. Within the Life Support Facility the Healers built a warehouse for storing Seeds, as well as rooms dedicated to their study.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> finds the brutalized and decaying body of the still living <a href="companions.html#deliverer">Deliverer</a> in a life support tank, after moving through the <a href="whispering_caves.html">Whispering Caves</a> and defeating <a href="fragment.html#fesh_togar">Fesh'Togar</a>. The Deliverer in the Tank has the appearance of a putrefying fetus. CT-41 converses with and kills the Deliverer, at his request, and his empowered Seed joins CT-41 in his journey.</p>

				<a id="regression_center"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Regression Center</div>

				<p>The Regression Center was a medical complex located in the Refuge, where <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> <a href="lineage.html#healer">Healers</a> administered <a href="regression_treatment.html">Regression Treatment</a> to <a href="rogue.html">Rogues</a> and <a href="Lumene Native.html">Native</a> criminals.</p>

				<p>Healers constructed mock-ups of long lost chambers from the <a href="chain_of_memory.html">Chain of Memory</a>, primordial biomes, and projection chambers in the Regression Center, to stimulate the recall of ancient memories and encourage immersion in them. In the Regression Center they also experimented with electrical and photonic stimulation of the Native <a href="seed.html">Seed</a>, but these more direct treatments were still in their infancy when <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a> ushered the <a href="kindred.html">Kindred</a> into the <a href="age.html#dark_age">Dark Age</a>.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> passes through the Regression Center as it moves toward the <a href="#surgical_complex">Surgical Complex</a>. Lighting is poor in the Regression Center after thousands of years of disuse, and the projected images and holograms are intermittent and jittery.</p>

				<a id="surgical_complex"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Surgical Complex</div>

				<p>The Surgical Complex was a facility, built by the <a href="lineage.html#healer">Healers</a>, where the bodies of injured <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a> were repaired. The Surgical Complex contained operation rooms, fluid stores, research chambers, disection tables, and tissue and specimen samples.</p>

				<p>The Surgical Complex began as a series of hospital chambers during the <a href="tribal_wars">Tribal Wars</a>, where the battered alliance of <a href="lineage.html#nurturer">Nurturers</a> and <a href="lineage.html#philosopher">Philosophers</a> tended to their wounded. The arts of medicine and triage advanced rapidly during the War, and when it was over, certain Nurturers decided to continue to study the science of Native anatomy and wellness. Healers treated many maimed <a href="lineage.html#explorer">Explorers</a> and <a href="lineage.html#warrior">Warriors</a> in the Surgical Complex, as a gesture of goodwill to their former enemies.</p>

				<p>The Surgical Complex grew as the <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html#turn">Turns</a> passed, and it became a large and sophisticated facility. In the aftermath of the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a>, those suffering radiation burns and crush wounds were brought to the Complex, where Healers used advanced medical techniques to restore as much of their health and mobility as possible.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> enters the Surgical Facility and finds the <a href="../items.html#native_prosthetic">Native Prosthetic</a> in a prosthetics lab. It notices that <a href="servant.html">Servants</a> in the Surgical Complex near <a href="fragment.html#fesh_togar">Fesh'togar's</a> <a href="sanctum.html">Sanctum</a> do not stop moving until their bodies are completely destroyed. This is due to Fesh'togar's unnerving ability to manage the low level biochemical processes of his Servants even after their neural structures are damaged.</p>

				<p>Lighting is dim and erratic in the Surgical Complex, and CT-41 begins to hear the winds of the <a href="#whispering_caves">Whispering Caves</a> as it navigates the Complex's flickering halls. Before it can move into Fesh'togar's Sanctum, CT-41 discovers the <a href="puppet.html">Puppet</a>, a reanimated Native, in an operation chamber. After destroying the Puppet, CT-41 takes the <a href="../items.html#ITEM">#ITEM</a> that it carried and continues on its journey.</p>


				<a id="whispering_caves"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Whispering Caves</div>

				<p>The Whispering Caves were a series of tight caverns in the deepest recesses of the Refuge, where swift currents of air blew, moving objects and creating deep haunting tones that could be heard faintly from the <a href="#surgical_complex">Surgical Complex</a> and <a href="#life_support_facility">Life Support Facility</a>.</p>

				<p>The Whispering Caves were first settled by a secretive <a href="lumene_native.html">Native</a> population of the <a href="lineage.html#philosopher">Philosopher's</a> <a href="lineage.html">Lineage</a> during the <a href="age.html#tribal">Tribal Age</a>. These Natives disappeared long before the <a href="unification.html">Unification</a>, but left curious artifacts and intricate wall etchings dotted with <a href="glowstone.html">Glowstone</a> in the Whispering Caves. The <a href="lineage.html#healer">Healers</a> that later occupied the Refuge preserved the ruins in the Whispering Caves as they found them, to honor the lost Natives.</p>

				<p>During the <a href="age.html#dark">Dark Age</a>, the Whispering Caves became <a href="fragment.html#sanctum">Fesh'togar's</a> <a href="sanctum.html">Sanctum</a>, from which he extended the will of <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a> throughout his <a href="domain.html">Domain</a>. In the Whispering Caves Fesh'togar learned to control the currents of air that howled through his home. He was curious about the reanimation of dead flesh, and learned to control <a href="servant.html">Servants</a> whose <a href="seed.html">Seeds</a> had been destroyed or removed.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> enters the Whispering Caves after defeating the <a href="puppet.html">Puppet</a>, and is battered as he moves through the caverns by strong gusts of wind. CT-41 encounters fully grown <a href="../creatures.html#dragon.html">Dragons</a> here, preferred Servants and protectors of Fesh'togar.</p>

				<p>After defeating Fesh'togar's guard, CT-41 enters his private chamber, and destroys the Spirit of Air. Once Fesh'togar is no longer able to maintain his form, his <a href="self.html">Self</a> is captured in the <a href="necrolith.html">Necrolith</a>. Bearing his new prisoner, CT-41 is able to pass by the <a href="../creatures.html#sentinel">Sentinel</a> that blocks passage to the Life Support Facility.</p>
