				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Assembly Hall was a large vaulted chamber atop the <a href="lineage.html#ruler">Rulers</a>' <a href="locus.html">Locus</a>, just below the <a href="womb.html">Womb</a>. It connected to the east and west with the <a href="highway.html">Highway</a>, making it an ideal meeting place.

				<p>The Assembly Hall was an ancient gathering place for the <a href="lineage.html#ruler">Rulers</a>, where they conducted commerce, debated philosophy, formulated language, and met with other <a href="lineage.html">Lineages</a>. After the <a href="tribal_wars.html">Tribal Wars</a> the Assembly Hall was also used as a venue for holding <a href="great_council.html">Great Councils</a> every quarter <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html#turn">Turn</a>. As Lumene society matured the Assembly Hall was renovated and amplified from a simple cavern to a larger and more ornate formal chamber.</p>

				<p>The furnishing of the Hall was entirely dependent on the occasion for its use, but it did have permanent fixtures. Large ceremonial lamps hung from the roof of the cavern, and tall columns held up the weight of the ceiling. The walls and ceilings of the Assembly Hall sported ledges and perches from which spectators could observe proceedings.</p>

				<p>The Hall contained seven daises for use during Great Councils, one for each Lineage. When occupied, a dais would raise its occupant high above the floor of the Hall, so that he could be seen by all present. Whenever a dais was raised during a Council all artificial lights were turned off, and the Assembly hall was left in near darkness, so that the speaker's light could be clearly seen. Those who produced light without the Rulers' permission were ushered out of the Council. The Rulers presided over scheduling and procedings in the Assembly Hall, regulating trade, choosing speakers and arbitrating disputes.</p>

				<p>Near the end of the <a href="uprising.html">Uprising</a>, after the Remnant was driven back from <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme's</a> <a href="temple.html">Temple</a>, most surviving Natives congregated to the Assembly Hall. They sealed the western entrance leading to the Temple as best they could, and held the Last Council, preparing to continue their war against the Tyrant. However, before they could orchestrate any offensive, an army of lifeforms from the Womb and the <a href="deep.html">Deep</a>, controlled by Thosmodeme, broke into the Assembly Hall.</p>

				<p>These creatures alone would not have been able to overcome the Natives, but the ranks of Thosmodeme's army were bolstered by <a href="beast.html">Beasts</a> from the <a href="hunting_grounds.html">Hunting Grounds</a> to the distant east. Among the <a href="kindred.html">Kindred</a> only the <a href="lineage.html#warrior">Warriors</a> had been a physical match for Beasts, and they had been extinct for more than an <a href="age.html">Age</a>. The Remnant, equipped only with makeshift weaponry, was defeated, and the <a href="slaughter.html">Slaughter</a> began.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> enters the Assembly Hall, and finds it filled with the mounded remains of many creatures, among them hundreds of Lumene Natives. The western door is still heavily barricaded. All Natives in the Assembly Hall have had their <a href="seed.html">Seeds</a> removed. Among the ruin CT-41 finds the #ITEM.</p>
