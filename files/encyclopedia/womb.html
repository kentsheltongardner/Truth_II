				<p>The Womb was a network of warm, watery caverns beneath and to the west of the <a href="sea.html">Sea</a>, where the primitive ancestors of the <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a> evolved. The Womb was considered sacred by the Natives, and was <a href="sanctification.html">Sanctified</a> by the <a href="lineage.html#ruler">Rulers</a> during the <a href="age.html#enlightened">Enlightened Age</a>. The Womb served as a refuge to many Natives of the <a href="remnant.html">Remnant</a> during the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a>, and during the <a href="age.html#hidden">Hidden Age</a>, surviving Natives returned to and beautified their ancient <a href="locus.html">Loci</a> that surrounded it.</p>

				<p>The Womb served as a large park and conservation area for the Natives, and was a central area between the Loci where the lesser lifeforms of the Lumene <a href="underground.html">Underground</a> were permitted to flourish relatively undisturbed. It was in the Womb that a <a href="lineage.html#farmer">Farmer</a> of the Remnant discovered a <a href="proto_native.html">Proto-Native</a> that had wakened from <a href="dormancy.html">Dormancy</a> during the Destruction. It was from this Proto-Native that the <a href="lineage.html#laborer">Laborer</a>'s <a href="lineage.html">Lineage</a> descended.</p>

				<p>After the <a href="uprising.html">Uprising</a> and the <a href="slaughter.html">Slaughter</a>, the Womb became the <a href="domain.html">Domain</a> of <a href="fragment.html#uruthmu">Uruthmu</a>, a <a href="fragment.html#greater_fragment">Greater Fragment</a> of <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a>. In the fertile pools of the Womb Uruthmu bred <a href="servant.html">Servants</a> for Thosmodeme, and fed them with thick <a href="flow.html">Flow</a> from the <a href="dark_origin.html">Dark Origin</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> enters the Womb from the <a href="sunken_ship.html">Sunken Ship</a> at the bottom of the Sea, and navigates through its increasingly congested and defiled pools. CT-41 destroys the Dark Origin before passing through the lowest portions of the <a href="abyssal_trench.html">Abyssal Trench</a>, and confronting Uruthmu in his <a href="sanctum.html">Sanctum</a>.</p>
