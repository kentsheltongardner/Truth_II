				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>Magma Worms were enormous snakelike creatures that lived in the <a href="magma_chamber.html">Magma Chambers</a> and the liquid <a href="upper_mantle.html">Upper Mantle</a> of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>. They were the apex predators of the Mantle, ageless and invincible. They spent their lives navigating the strange eddies and currents of their home, and understood the universe in terms of a solid sphere below, and another solid sphere above.</p>

				<p>Though they were highly intelligent creatures and possessed incredible capacity for memorization, they could not conceive of the vastness of space, the idea of other worlds, or many other basic concepts which surface dwellers take for granted. In fact, Magma Worm minds were so large and alien, compared to those of <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Natives</a> or humans, that <a href="singularity.html">Singularities</a> such as <a href="azeselon.html">Azeselon</a>, <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a> and even the mighty <a href="voronash.html">Voronash</a> could not fully comprehend them, much less dominate them.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Lifecycle</div>
				<p>A Magma Worm's life began soon after its parent discovered or created a nest in the underside of the Lumene crust. Most nests were found in Magma Chambers, where temperature was cool compared to that of the Mantle. They were also free of the Mantle's strong currents, that could easily overpower a small Magma Worm and drag it to its death. The perennial presence of Magma Worm young and other lifeforms in these Chambers prevented them from permanently cooling.</p>

				<p>Adult Magma Worms had several bladders, where they cultivated populations of various smaller organisms. Before a Magma Worm adult gave birth, it attached itself to the underside of a dead Magma Chamber, and deposited an entire ecosystem of plant and animal life into the Chamber. After the biome in the Magma Chamber had matured, the Magma Worm returned to deposit thousands of its young. These would contend against and prey upon the creatures of the Magma Chamber, and each other.</p>

				<p>After several Turns, only one Magma Worm would remain of all those deposited in the Magma Chamber. When it reached the appropriate size, and after consuming all other lifeforms in the Chamber, the hungry Magma Worm adolescent would descend to the Mantle and begin its adult life. There it learned to hunt its true prey, and began to memorize the geography of the Upper Mantle. A fully grown Magma Worm Ancient would know the locations of every Magma Chamber, ridge, tunnel, vent, and current in the entire Upper Mantle, and could circumnavigate the globe with ease.</p>

				<p>On rare occasions two Magma Worm adolescents would work as cooperative pairs within the Magma Chamber, and would not canibalize each other. These pairs would remain together until death, traveling inseparably through the Mantle together as the ages passed.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Interactions with Lumene Natives</div>

				<p>The Lumene Natives guessed that creatures lived in the Upper Mantle, but were never able to confirm their existence. Their <a href="lineage.html#engineer">Engineers</a> occasionally observed the deep rumble of Magma Worm communication, and the seismic disturbances they caused as they created or reopened nests, but the Upper Mantle was simply too dangerous for even the bravest <a href="explorer.html">Explorers</a> to enter.</p>

				<p>The <a href="faithful.html">Faithful</a> and the <a href="worshipper.html">Worshippers</a> knew more of the Magma Worms than other Native populations, and formulated their <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html">Calendars</a> around the seismic activity that Magma Worms caused.</p>

				<p>Native Explorers and Laborers discovered ancient Magma Worm fossils in two cooled Magma Chambers branching from the Volcano's main vent.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a> <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> encounters Magma Worm young in the Magma Chambers, where Azeselon attempts to <a href="synchronization.html">Synchronize</a> with them, and adult Magma Worms in the Upper Mantle. CT-41 is able to defeat those Magma Worm young that attacked it, but none of its weapons have any discernable effect on adult Magma Worms, who ignore CT-41 entirely.</p>

				<p>CT-41 is able to move between five major Magma Chambers and the Underworld during Truth II, and interacts with all the instars of Magma Worm lifecycle. It can move into a Magma Chamber that it is devoid of life, one where a primordial biome blooms, one where infant Magma Worms have been deposited, one where several Magma Worm children have settled into their own caverns, and one where a single Magma Worm adolescent remains in the chamber. The current state of the Magma Worm lifecycle affects CT-41's exploration options in the Magma Chambers.</p>
