				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>The Age was the broadest time period codified by <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene</a> historians. Ages were delineated by cosmological, geological, evolutionary or historical events rather than any regular time period, and as such were distinct from <a href="lumene_timekeeping.html#turn">Turns</a>, <a href="life.html">Lives</a>, and <a href="cycle.html">Cycles</a>. The history studied by Native chroniclers drew heavily from lived experience from the <a href="chain_of_memory.html">Chain of Memory</a>, as well as from geological, fossil, archaeological and written records.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Lumene Ages</div>
				<a id="inanimate"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Inanimate Age</div>

				<p>The Inanimate Age began at the Big Bang, and ended when a meteor struck the surface of <a href="lumen_2.html">Lumen 2</a>, producing the <a href="fortuna_crater.html">Fortuna Crater</a>. It was conjectured by some Lumene <a href="healer.html">Healers</a> and <a href="lineage.html#engineer">Engineers</a> that the meteor strike shattered the planet's crust, and allowed simple organisms from the <a href="upper_mantle.html">Upper Mantle</a> to begin moving upward. Others believed that the meteor carried organic chemicals that flourished into life. Regardless, it was near the time of the impact that fossils of simple organisms began to form in sediments near the Fortuna Crater.</p>

				<a id="genetic"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Genetic Age</div>
				
				<p>The Genetic Age began with the appearance of simple lifeforms in the crust of Lumen 2, and ended when the mind of the <a href="primordion.html">Primordion</a> developed in an ancient Native ancestor living in the <a href="womb.html">Womb</a>. It was within the <a href="seed.html">Seed</a> of this creature that the Chain of Memory began to form</a>.</p>

				<a id="aquatic"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Aquatic Age</div>
				
				<p>The Aquatic Age began when the mind of the Primordion developed, and allowed its bearer to become the dominant lifeform in the shallow regions of the <a href="sea.html">Sea</a> and the pools surrounding it. The Aquatic Age ended when the first <a href="proto_native.html">Proto-Native</a> emerged from the waters, and began to move on land.</p>

				<a id="emergent"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Emergent Age</div>
				
				<p>The Emergent Age began as Proto-Natives moved to land, and the mind of the <a href="simpleton.html">Simpleton</a> formed. This new creature began to create tunnels and burrows, and aided the <a href="old_god.html">Old Gods</a> in their hunts. The Emergent Age ended with the <a href="pre_tribal_extinction.html">Pre-Tribal Extinction</a>, when a coronal mass ejection from <a href="lumen.html">Lumen</a> killed much of the life on Lumen 2.</p>

				<a id="tribal"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Tribal Age</div>
				
				<p>The Tribal Age began when the Old Gods died or entered <a href="dormancy.html">Dormancy</a>, and the Lumene Natives ascended to became the dominant lifeform of the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>. The mind of the <a href="luminary.html">Luminary</a> formed within the <a href="common_ancestor.html">Common Ancestor</a>, and different populations of Natives became isolated and formed distinct cultures. The Tribal Age ended with the <a href="tribal_wars.html">Tribal Wars</a>, and the <a href="unification.html">Unification</a>.</p>

				<a id="enlightened"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Enlightened Age</div>
				
				<p>The Enlightened Age began with the Unification of the <a href="kindred.html">Kindred</a>, and ended with the first permanent dwellings being built on the surface of Lumen 2. During the Enlightened Age Lumene Natives developed industrial technologies that allowed them to sustain larger populations, and survive the hostile conditions on their planet's surface.</p>

				<a id="planetary"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Planetary Age</div>

				<p>The Planetary Age began as Lumene Natives began to cover the surface of their world. Lumene civilization spread outwards from the Fortuna Crater, and settlements of the Kindred were found all across Lumen 2. The Planetary Age ended when Lumene <a href="explorer.html">Explorers</a> escaped the relatively weak gravity well of their homeworld, and established the first permanent base on <a href="nox.html">Nox</a>.</p>

				<a id="stellar"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Stellar Age</div>
				
				<p>The Stellar Age began as Lumene Natives began to visit and colonize their moon and the other planets in the Lumen system. The Age ended when Explorer <a href="probe.html">Probes</a> were discovered by <a href="destroyer.html">Destroyer</a> sensor stations, and latent Destroyer constructs activated to bring the <a href="destruction.html">Destruction</a> to all worlds populated by Lumene Natives.</p>

				<a id="hidden"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Hidden Age</div>
				
				<p>The Hidden Age began with the Destruction, when the <a href="remnant.html">Remnant</a> gathered to the Womb. The Age ended when <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme's</a> <a href="laborer.html">Laborers</a> sealed the <a href="ruler.html">Rulers</a> and <a href="executor.html">Executors</a> in their <a href="locus.html">Locus</a>, ushering in the <a href="subjugation.html">Subjugation</a>.</p>

				<a id="dark"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Dark Age</div>
				
				<p>The Dark Age, also called the Last Age, began with the Subjugation. After the <a href="slaughter.html">Slaughter</a> no Native chroniclers remained to codify any new Ages, and this age was considered to have been the last.</p>
