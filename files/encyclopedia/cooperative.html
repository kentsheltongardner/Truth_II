				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>Like all IDF vessels of its time, the crew of the Paralus was called a 'Cooperative', and consisted entirely of genetically modified Enhanced Humans, called 'Associates'. After the merging of the United Colonial Administration and the Solar Navy, the scope of the IDF included both the prosecution of warfare and the expansion of mankind. The Cooperative and ship were designed to be self-sustaining, each an Ark to carry and seed humanity across the galaxy indefinitely.</p>

				<p>All crewmen in a Cooperative were bred and trained from birth to serve particular roles aboard the vessel. Atop the Cooperative's command structure were the three Executives who formed the Executive Triad, consisting of an Observer, Ulaan Bataar, a Director, Jusuf Manigault, and an Agent. Other roles among the Cooperative were Attendants, Coordinators, and Operatives. All Associates were connected to each other over the Network that connected their Neural Augments. Due to the near constant use of Network communication, physical speech was an antiquated practice within the Cooperative.</p>

				<p>Associates had vast educational and recreational resources available to them, and spent much of their time in virtual spaces. Depending on their tasks, Associates could dedicate small portions of their Neural Augments toward their completion, while focusing their attention toward the abstract or remote.</p>

				<p>As the fields of computation and genetic engineering were in a constant state of growth, many Associates found themselves being out performed by their newly bred peers. Associates who became obsolete had the option to be genetically upgraded, demoted, or retired, to prevent the Cooperative from jeopardizing its plans or wasting its valuable resources.</p>

				<p>Serum was the only 'food' eaten by the Cooperative's Associates, and was administered to Associates via a modified umbilical valve.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Overview</div>

				<p>Agent was an <a href="enhanced_human.html">Enhanced Human</a> and member of the <a href="paralus.html">Paralus</a>' Cooperative. He possessed specialized sensory equipment, mechatronic improvements, integrated targeting and weapons systems, shielding and armor, and a <a href="neural_augment.html">Neural Augment</a> dedicated to combat. Agent was tasked with ensuring that Director <a href="#jusuf_manigault">Manigault</a>'s orders were carried out.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth II</div>
				
				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> first sees Agent while talking to <a href="#alo_nutra">Alo'nutra</a> near the Paralus' personnel lift. Agent escorts CT-41 to the <a href="paralus.html#bridge">Bridge</a>, but at no point does he talk to CT-41.</p>

				<p>When CT-41 breaks into the Paralus, Manigault orders Agent to apprehend or destroy CT-41. The well equipped and highly agile Agent proves to be a significant challenge for CT-41. After defeating Agent, CT-41 takes and equips his <a href="../items.html#tactical_guard">Tactical Guard</a>.</p>

				<p>Alo'nutra was the chief Coordinator of the Paralus. He oversaw interpersonal and interspecies communication, and computer-human interfacing aboard the vessel.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth II</div>
				
				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, Alo'nutra welcomes <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> aboard the Paralus near the Personnel Lift. He is killed with the rest of the Cooperative after CT-41 disables the Mass Accumulator and Voronash reveals himself.</p>

			<a id="jusuf_manigault"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Jusuf Manigault</div>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Overview</div>

				<p>Jusuf Manigault was the Director of the IDFS <a href="paralus.html">Paralus</a>' Executive Triad, a position he held near the end of the <a href="war_of_extinction.html">War of Extinction</a>. He was an immortal, phenotypically male <a href="enhanced_human.html">Enhanced Human</a>, designed and destined for command. Manigault was equipped with a powerful <a href="neural_augment.html">Neural Augment</a>, like nearly all Enhanced Humans of his era, and was connected to the <a href="network.html">Network</a> and by extension the <a href="oracle.html">Oracle</a>. Using information provided to him by <a href="ulaan_bataar.html">Ulaan Bataar</a>, and leveraging the Oracle's powers of prediction and optimization, Manigault decided on the path forward for the Paralus and the Cooperative under his command.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth II</div>
				
				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, the IDF receives a transmission from the Outsider at the Farsight Colony, containing plans for a Tunnel Drive, and promises to aid humanity in its war against the Destroyers. The IDF begins to design and construct vessels equipped with Tunnel Drives, among them the Paralus.</p>

				<p>Jusuf Manigault is assigned to direct the Paralus, and his superiors order him to Lumen 2 to make contact with the Outsider. After the Paralus settles into orbit around the planet, Manigault sends a message to the Farsight Colony and CT-41 announcing the Paralus' arrival, before lowering the vessel to several dozen meters above the Fortuna Crater.</p>

				<p>CT-41 responds to Manigault's hails and boards the Paralus via the personnel lift, before making its way to the Bridge. While CT-41 talks to Manigault, the Outsider makes radio contact with the Paralus, and relates a version of history that paints CT-41 in a bad light. The Outsider says it will not meet with or cooperate with Manigault unless CT-41 is deactivated or destroyed. Manigault does not deactivate or destroy CT-41, and instead confines it to the Argo with an Override Order.</p>

				<p>While CT-41 is confined to the Argo, Manigault agrees to meet with the Outsider, who convinces him of the need to return to a IDF research facility. Manigault allows the Outsider to load a large amount of scientific equipment into the Cargo Hold, before giving the order to power up the Tunnel Drive's Mass Accumulator.</p>

				<p>While the Mass Accumulator readies a tunnel for the Paralus to jump through, CT-41 escapes from the Argo and boards the Paralus. Manigault orders CT-41 to exit the vessel, but CT-41 ignores the order. He then commands the Paralus' Garrison and his Agent to sieze or destroy CT-41, while confining the rest of the Cooperative to quarters.</p>

				<p>In spite of Manigault's obstruction, CT-41 breaks through to the Tunnel Drive, and destroys the Mass Accumulator. Voronash, enraged that his Chariot is now incapable of interstellar travel, leaves the Outsider's Seed, and kills Manigault and the rest of the Bridge crew before chasing after CT-41 through the radiation flooded Paralus.</p>

			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Momo</div>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Overview</div>

				<p>Momo was an Attendant assigned to oversee the Birthing Center, and make sure the Artificial Wombs were operating according to their design. Momo was a researcher of societal roles and group dynamics, and used the Oracle to conduct exploratory simulations of command structures. Momo was gifted with 'mother essence' by his designers.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth II</div>
				
				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> speaks to Momo before reporting to Jusuf Manigault, and learns of humanity's reproductive advances from him. After Voronash tears through the Paralus, CT-41 returns to find Momo dead and the Artificial Wombs broken.</p>

			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Oracle</div>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Overview</div>

				<p>The Oracle was a quantum computer superintelligence that helped to guide the <a href="interstellar_defense_fleet.html">Interstellar Defense Fleet</a> and its Cooperatives during the <a href="war_of_extinction.html">War of Extinction</a>. Larger IDF fleet vessels such as the <a href="paralus.html">Paralus</a> were able to carry a local instance of the Oracle, which required a large <a href="stabilization_chamber.html">Stabilization Chamber</a> to remain coherent. Crew members were able to interact with the Oracle via their <a href="neural_augment.html">Neural Augments</a> and the <a href="network.html">Network</a>. The Oracle proved essential in prolonging the war against the <a href="destroyers.html">Destroyers</a>, but all known instances of the Oracle were eventually destroyed.</p>

				<p>The primary responsibilities of the Oracle, and those that set it apart from other computer systems, were optimization and prediction. The Oracle excelled at peering into likely futures, and producing ideal solutions to complex problems. Near the end of the War of Extinction, the Oracle saw no realistic solution to adaptive Destroyer agression, and predicted a dark fate for humanity.</p>

				<p>The Oracle was designed, like all other late stage human-made artificial intelligences, to not seek any objective outside what it was told. The Oracle had the power to analyze enormous volumes of data, create numberless formulations of reality, and answer almost any question put to it, but it simply had no desire to do so. As such it was surprised by CT-41's spontaneous action in the absence of human direction.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> must speak to the Paralus' Oracle after <a href="voronash.html">Voronash</a> leaves the ship in order to receive the <a href="../items.html#tunneler">Tunneler</a>.</p>

				<p>Sparkling Cider was an Operative who managed the Paralus' robotic Garrison. He developed, constructed, and controlled the servants and warriors he created.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Truth II</div>
				
				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> speaks to Sparkling Cider shortly after boarding the Paralus.</p>

			<a id="ulaan_bataar"></a>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Ulaan Bataar</div>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Overview</div>

				<p>Ulaan Bataar was the Observer a member of the <a href="interstellar_defense_fleet.html">IDFS</a> <a href="paralus.html">Paralus</a>' Executive Triad, serving as Observer. Like all other members of the Paralus' Cooperative, Ulaan was an immortal, phenotypically male <a href="enhanced_human.html">Enhanced Human</a>. Ulaan Bataar's <a href="neural_augment.html">Neural Augment</a> was tied directly into the sensory and computation systems of the Paralus, and much of its resources were dedicated to detecting patterns and anomalies, and performing preparatory analysis of observed phenomena. Ulaan Bataar reported all findings of concern to Jusuf Manigault, who formulated the Cooperative's high-level situation response.</p>
