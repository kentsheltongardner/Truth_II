				<p>The Well of Offering was a stony hole at the heart of the <a href="holy_city.html#temple">Temple</a>, whose mouth led down into the <a href="throneroom.html">Throneroom</a>. When it came time for a <a href="child.html">Child</a> or <a href="servant.html">Servant</a> of <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a> to be joined with him, the creature was brought to the Well of Offering, and given the chance to enter it voluntarily. Willing or not, the Child or Servant entered the Well, and fell into the darkness of the Throneroom, and the cool, still waters of the Pool. Thosmodeme then revealed himself, and consumed his meal.</p>

				<p>With the exception of <a href="vessel.html">Vessels</a> and <a href="fragment.html">Fragments</a>, which entered by a doorway on the eastern wall, all creatures that entered the Throneroom did so via the Well of Offering.</p>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> throws itself into the Well of Offering after defeating Thosmodme's <a href="fragment.html#greater_fragment">Greater Fragments</a> and infiltrating the Temple.</p>
