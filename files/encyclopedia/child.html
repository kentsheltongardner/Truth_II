				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>A Child of <a href="thosmodeme.html">Thosmodeme</a>, was a <a href="lumene_native.html">Lumene Native</a> or human that Thosmodeme governed, and to whom he taught his doctrine of <a href="purification.html">Purification</a>. During the <a href="subjugation.html">Subjugation</a>, the Native Children of Thosmodeme lived in their <a href="locus.html">Loci</a> surrounding the <a href="womb.html">Womb</a>. After <a href="cobbs_mutiny.html">Cobb's Mutiny</a>, the human Children of Thosmodeme were gathered to the <a href="sanctuary.html">Sanctuary</a>.</p>

				<p>Thosmodeme named his Native Children 'Unruly', and his human Children 'Meek', due to differences in their mental make-up and lifespan. Native neural structures were large, complex and fragmented, and were difficult for Thosmodeme to completely control. Born carrying a long <a href="chain_of_memory.html">Chain of Memory</a>, Natives were able to remember times before the Subjugation, whereas after only four generations the human Children knew only the Sanctuary, and Earth and the <a href="farsight_colony.html">Farsight Colony</a> were legends.</p>

				<p>Lumene Natives, as asexual beings, were far more emotionally independent than humans, and could not be exploited in ways that humans could. The long lifespans of the Natives also made them less malleable and susceptible to domination. During the Subjugation, Thosmodeme felt it necessary to resort to brutal punishments to control his native Children.</p>

				<p>Life was simpler for human Children living in the Sanctuary. Thosmodeme and his Servants provided for most of their needs, and the Children enjoyed a life of leisure and trivial pleasure. Human young were trained from infancy to idolize the Lord of Lumen and seek his Purification. In spite of the docility of human Children, Thosmodeme preferred his firstborn Natives.</p>

				<p>The final choice of a Child's life came when Thosmodeme brought him to the lip of the <a href="well_of_offering.html">Well of Offering</a>. There the Child was given the opportunity to willingly jump in. If the Child jumped in willingly, it would be devoured by Thosmodeme. Otherwise it was cast into the <a href="pit.html">Pit</a> of <a href="voronash.html">Voronash</a>.</p>
				
				<div class="entry-section-title">Truth II</div>

				<p>During the events of <a href="truth_ii.html">Truth II</a>, <a href="ct_41.html">CT-41</a> encounters many human Children of Thosmodeme in the Sanctuary, and convinces the <a href="companions.html#follower">Builder</a>, a Native <a href="lineage.html#laborer">Laborer</a> and loyal Child of Thosmodeme, to join it in opposing the Tyrant.</p>
