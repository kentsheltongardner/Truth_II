				<a id="dominator"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Dominator</div>

				<p>The Dominator is a psychological Tool developed by Healers to manipulate and control Lumene creatures. Controlled creatures will respond to CT-41's movement controls, obeying its commands to move up, down, left, right, and to jump. Like the Tranquilizer, the Dominator only affects creatures that possess a Lumene Seed.</p>

				Line of sight beam - Simplest, a target under the influence of the beam will respond
				Penetrating beam - Multiple targets, difficult to reach enemies
				Projectile - Multiple targets, timer on control

				CT-41 continues to move while controlling?

				<a id="boost_jets"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Boost Jets</div>

				<p>The Boost Jets allow CT-41 to add extra veritcal velocity while airborne, to aid jumps, slow descent, or increase horizontal jump distance. The Boost Jets consume a great deal of energy while in operation. CT-41 takes the Boost Jets from a drone sent down into the Waste Dump by Vadim Kozlov.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Overview</div>

				<p>During its life on Lumen 2, CT-41 receives items as gifts from members of the Farsight Expedition, retrieves abandoned items from the Farsight Colony and the Paralus, finds Native items from ruins in the Realm, and takes Destroyer items from the Vault and the Destroyer Wreck. When CT-41 finds an unknown item that is not compatible with its design, it must allow a certain amount of time for its Nanite Colony to analyze and adapt the foreign items for its use.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Tools</div>
				
				<p>Tools are items that CT-41 can equip on its right and left arms. Tools come in several different categories, which are discussed below. Many of the puzzles in Truth II can only be solved if CT-41 equips a correct pairing of Tools.</p>

				<p>Certain Tools can be upgraded or improved by CT-41 throughout Truth II. All Native Tools can be improved by filling their material storage compartments. When CT-41 completely fills a Native Tool's material chamber, it gains a major improvement and changes appearance.</p>

				<p>Destroyer Tools are distinct from Native and human Tools in that they do not drain CT-41's battery as they operate.</p>

				<p>Kozlov's Toy is a conceptual prototype, and when he made it Kozlov did not have the materials necessary for its operation. CT-41 finds exotic materials during its journey which allow the Toy to produce four seperate temporal beams.</p>

				<p>God items are made from Seeds taken from the Old Gods, and take many years for the Nanite Colony to fashion into the ultimate weapons, utility items, and defensive systems.</p>

			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Lasers</div>

				<p>Lasers are continuous, instantaneously damaging weapons. Lasers can be improved by Optimus, an optimization program written by Otis Cobb and gifted to CT-41. A fully optimized laser deals twice as much damage to enemies as an unoptimized laser. Optimization of lasers occurs more quickly as CT-41 encounters new enemies.</p>

				<p>Lasers and laser combinations can be used to interact with Glowstones of different colors.</p>

				<a id="thermal_laser"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Thermal Laser</div>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Native Weapons</div>

				<a id="scattershot"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Scattershot</div>

				<p>The Scattershot is a close range energy weapon once used by Warriors. It fires a high number of energized projectiles at incredible velocities, with additive knockback based on the number of projectiles striking a target. The Scattershot produces recoil, and has a long recharge time. CT-41 finds the Scattershot in a bone pit in the Beasthome.</p>

				<a id="pentaquarks"></a>

				<p><b>Pentaquarks</b> increase the shot count and spread of the Scattershot.</p>

				<a id="particle_emitter"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Particle Emitter</div>

				<p>The Particle Emitter is a piece of scientific equipment CT-41 finds in the Accelerator. It rapidly emits particles that each apply a small knockback to a target. The Particle Emitter also causes CT-41 to experience the highest overall recoil of any Tool.</p>

				<a id="free_electrons"></a>

				<p><b>Free Electrons</b> increase the fire rate and velocity of the Particle Emitter.</p>

				<a id="corner_cutter"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Corner Cutter</div>

				<p>The Corner Cutter is an Explorer's weapon, taken for self-defense and hunting long journeys into the unknown. Its fast, particulate shots ricochet off walls and most inorganic objects, allowing the skilled Explorer to snipe prey and threats from otherwise impossible vantage points. The Corner Cutter's projectiles decrease in energy after each bounce, before finally impacting a valid target or dissipating. Each time the Corner Cutter's projectile bounces off a wall, it produces a radial shockwave and becomes smaller. CT-41 finds the Corner Cutter west of the Lower Ruins.</p>

				<a id="q-balls"></a>

				<p><b>Q-Balls</b> increase the initial power of projectiles launched from the Corner Cutter, and thereby increase the number of bounces.</p>

				<a id="volt_gun"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Volt Gun</div>

				<p>The Volt Gun is an electrical Tool used to temporarily charge and power machinery and robotics. It has a deleterious effect on most lifeforms, dealing slight damage and stunning them briefly. CT-41 finds the Volt Gun in the Upper Root Fields after defeating the Overgrowth. CT-41 must use the Volt Gun to navigate several areas of the Realm before it restores power by defeating the Vermin Supreme.</p>

				<a id="superconductors"></a>

				<p><b>Superconductors</b> increase the bounce count, stun duration, and damage that the Volt Gun deals to enemies. They also increase the amount and duration of power provided to machinery.</p>

				<a id="tranquilizer"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Tranquilizer</div>

				<p>The Tranquilizer is a Tool developed by Farmers and Warriors to sedate Natives and other Lumene creatures. Once hit by a pulse from the Tranquilizer, a target creature will become unresponsive for up to several seconds, depending on its size, or until attacked. The Tranquilizer only affects creatures that possess a Lumene Seed. CT-41 finds the Tranquilizer in the Menagerie.</p>

				<p><b>Photonic Molecules</b> increase the stun duration of the Tranquilizer.</p>

				<a id="energy_siphon"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Energy Siphon</div>

				<p>The Energy Siphon is a beam that dissipates an object's molecular energy, pushing it toward extreme low temperature. If it is trained on a target long enough it will cause it to freeze, at which point the object can be shattered by a sufficiently energetic impact. The Energy Siphon increases CT-41's energy if trained on a living target. CT-41 finds the Energy Siphon in a cryogenics lab in the Refuge.</p>

				<a id="bose_einstein_condensates"></a>

				<!--
					Physics of the Energy Siphon are difficult
				-->

				<p><b>Bose-Einstein Condensates</b> increase the freeze rate of the Heat Sink.</p>

				<a id="medusa"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Medusa</div>

				<p>The Medusa is a devastating experimental weapon created by Native Engineers. When fired at a target, and depending on the target's mass, the Medusa petrifies the target completely. The Medusa uses an enormous amount of energy, and has no effect on a target if the energy required to petrify the target is more than CT-41 can store in its battery. If CT-41 misses a valid target, its battery will be drained completely. CT-41 finds the Medusa in the Flow Caverns.</p>

				<a id="degenerate_matter"></a>

				<p><b>Degenerate Matter</b> increases the upper mass limit for ossification by the Medusa.</p>


				<a id="criticality_lance"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Criticality Lance</div>
				
				<p>The Criticality Lance is a powerful penetrating beam adapted from the body of a Magma Worm adolescent. The weapon glows blue as CT-41 powers it up, and discharges an incredibly powerful gamma ray burst that penetrates matter. The weapon only fires for an instant, but leaves visible plasma or heated material along its path. The Criticality Lance can be powered past a threshold at which it begins to produce dangerous levels of ambient radiation, damaging CT-41. The damage dealt to CT-41 increases as the Lance is charged up past the threshold.</p>

				<a id="actinides"></a>

				<p><b>Actinides</b> increase the charge rate of the Criticality Lance.</p>

				<a id="turbine"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Turbine</div>

				<p>The Turbine is a mariner's Tool that pulls the user forward through the water. CT-41 finds the Turbine in the Pump Station after it equips the Hydraulic Pistons from the Hall of Relics. CT-41 must use the Turbine (or the Hydraulic Pistons alone) to enter the Domains of Thosmodeme's Fragments.</p>

				<a id="superfluid"></a>

				<p><b>Superfluid</b> increases the impulse applied to CT-41 by the Turbine.</p>

				<a id="strange_attractor"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Strange Attractor</div>

				<p>The Strange Attractor is a Tool developed by Native Engineers which creates an attracting force between CT-41 and a target. The magnitudes of the impulses generated by the Strange Attractor are based on the inverse square of the distance between CT-41 and the target.</p>

				<a id="gravitons"></a>

				<p><b>Gravitons</b> increase the magnitudes of the symmetrical impulses generated by the Strange Attractor.</p>

				<a id="divining_rod"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Divining Rod</div>

				<p>The Divining Rod is a thief's Tool that detects abnormal Materials in a cone by flashing. The Divining Rod flashes most rapidly when a Material is close to the Rod, and near the center of the cone. CT-41 finds the Divining Rod in the Prospecting Camp at the top-western end of the Badlands.</p>

				<a id="neutrinos"></a>

				<p><b>Neutrinos</b> increase the effective width of the Divining Rod's search cone.</p>

				<a id="mass_inhibitor"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Mass Inhibitor</div>

				<p>The Mass Inhibitor is a work Tool once used by Laborers and other Natives to help transport heavy loads. CT-41 finds it in the Quarry behind an enormous cut stone.</p>

				<a id="higgs_bosons"></a>

				<p><b>Higgs Bosons</b> reduces the energy requirements of the Mass Inhibitor.</p>

				<a id="tunneler"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Tunneler</div>

				<p>The Tunneler is a personal version of the Paralus' Tunnel Drive. It allows a user to jump across space, through barriers and obstacles, at the cost of enormous amounts of energy. Space visibly curves while the Tunneler's mass accumulator rapidly powers up for the jump, and then quickly returns to its normal curvature after the jump is complete. CT-41 finds the Tunneler while fleeing from Voronash aboard the Paralus. CT-41 must have the Tunneler before moving up through the Openings or into the Nucleus through the most difficult stretch of the Razor Caverns. The Tunneler does not allow CT-41 to teleport into liquids. The Tunneler comes with a circular indicator which shows the maximal jump distance for CT-41's center of mass.</p>

				<a id="native_prosthetics"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Native Prosthetics</div>
				
				<p>The Native Prosthetics are a unique pair of Native items that CT-41 finds in a prosthetics lab in the Refuge. Unlike all other items, the Prosthetics can only be equipped simultaneously. When equipped, they allow CT-41 to interface with Terminals, and control advanced Native machinery and robotics, such as mining equipment, sentry turrets, fans, and more. Unlike other Native Tools, the prosthetics cannot be upgraded by Materials.</p>

				<p>In order to control Native machinery, CT-41 must move next to terminal and equip the Prosthetics, and then left-click on the Terminal. The Prosthetics extend to interface, and CT-41 controls present or remote technology until it right-clicks. CT-41 cannot communicate with the Deliverer or the Intelligence without the Prosthetics.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Destroyer Weapons</div>
				<a id="coronal_aperture"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Coronal Aperture</div>

				<p>The Coronal Aperture is a Destroyer weapon that opens to spew out coronal plasma and radiation. Like all Destroyer weapons, the Coronal Aperture does not require energy from CT-41's battery to fire. CT-41 takes the Coronal Aperture from the Torchbearer at at the center of the Darkstar.</p>

				<a id="volatility_launcher"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Volatility Launcher</div>

				<p>The Volatility Launcher is a Destroyer weapon which CT-41 takes from the Enforcer in the Restricted Area of the Hearth. The Launcher opens a tunnel that admits a Volatility, a bouncing, semi-stable anti-matter grenade designed to detonate when triggered by the Launcher, or after a certain time elapses. The Launcher propels the Volatility at a speed determined by the amount of time CT-41 charges the device. The device charges rapidly, firing at a minimum velocity when not charged and at a maximum velocity after charging for 1 second.</p>

				<p>When the Volatility detonates, it deals large damage and knockback. Unlike most other weapons, the Volatility Launcher deals heavy damage to CT-41 if misused. As a Destroyer weapon, the Launcher does not take energy to fire. The anti-matter grenade hurled by the Launcher is a physical object, and can be manipulated by physical and temporal effects.</p>

				<a id="kozlovs_toy"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-title">Kozlov's Toy</div>

				<p>Kozlov's Toy is a conceptual prototype built by Vadim Kozlov. At the time of the Toy's manufacture, Kozlov did not have the materials necessary for its operation. CT-41 finds exotic materials during its journey which allow the Toy to fire four separate beams. As the Toy fires at an object, it drains energy based on the object's mass. CT-41 finds Kozlov's Toy in Kozlov's Lab. CT-41 is unable to enter Thosmodeme's Temple until it has found Kozlov's Toy and all of the Materials necessary to enable its first three beams.</p>

				<p>Kozlov's Toy operates in one of four separate modes, rather than as four separate Tools, to prevent the use of two time manipulation beams at the same time. When different Materials are equipped in the Toy, pulses will move quickly or slowly down the beam, there will be no pulses, or pulses will move backward.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Slow</div>

				<a id="strange_matter"></a>

				<a id="aerial_thrusters"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Aerial Thrusters</div>

				<p>The Aerial Thrusters are thrusters given to CT-41 by Vadim Kozlov. The Thrusters allow CT-41 to move horizontally while mid-air.</p>

<!--
				Basic movements such as the thrusters should not change throughout the game. Thrusters should feel tight from the get go.

				<a id="maneuvering_jets"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Maneuvering Jets</div>

				<p>The Maneuvering Jets are powerful thrusters CT-41 takes from the #SITUATION. The Jets allow CT-41 to move quickly while in air.</p>

				<a id="nanite_colony"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Nanite Colony</div>

				<p>The Nanite Colony is a hive of self-replicating nanites that slowly repair CT-41 after it takes damage. Although they cannot repair its carbon-lattice brain, the nanites can keep CT-41 ready for exploration and combat unless it takes catastrophic damage. CT-41 receives the Colony as a gift from Dr. Ines Orozco.</p>

				<p>As it explores Lumen 2, CT-41 finds many items and materials that were not designed to be use by it. The Nanite Colony can spend days, weeks, or years analyzing the items, and adapting them for compatibility with CT-41's systems.</p>

				<a id="destroyer_kernel"></a>
				<div class="entry-section-subtitle">Destroyer Kernel</div>

				<p>The Destroyer Kernel is an item taken from the destroyed Custodian. Once CT-41 has the Destroyer Kernel in its possession, it can pass through Destroyer Gateways.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Materials</div>

				<p>Materials do not help CT-41 by themselves, but can be used to improve many of CT-41's Tools. Many Native Tools grow in power as more materials are poured into them, while Kozlov's Toy changes in function when a new material is slotted into it. Most materials are found many times throughout the Underground, while the materials that enable Kozlov's Toy are only found once.</p>

				<p>As materials were scarce, difficult, costly and time consuming to produce, and highly useful, they are typically well hidden or protected by their owners. Large amounts of Materials can be found in the Sunken Ship, in the Vault, and in the Prospecting Camp.</p>

				<p>Each Material that CT-41 can find and use is listed next to the Tool it improves.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Item Strategies and Tricks</div>

				<p>CT-41 uses the Volt Gun to arch lightning across several enemies and reach exposed wiring that is otherwise impossible to target.</p>

				<p>CT-41 fires the Scattershot and the Particle Emitter simultaneously and continuously for maximal added velocity before and during a jump.</p>

				<p>CT-41 shoots an object with the Mass Inhibitor, and the hits it with the Impact Cannon. The object flies away at high velocity, and when CT-41 is no longer shooting it with the Mass Inhibitor, its momentum rises dramatically.</p>

				<p>CT-41 shoots an an enemy that typically self-destructs with the Medusa, and uses the resulting stony mass as a weight to press a switch, or as a platform for jumping.</p>

				<p>CT-41 uses the Impact Cannon in tandem with its Aerial Thruster to work its way up very steep slopes or walls. With increased power generation, battery, shielding and armor, the vertical distance it can scale increases.</p>

				<p>CT-41 uses the Mass Inhibitor in tandem with the Medusa to petrify large objects.</p>

				<p>CT-41 uses the Corner Cutter and/or the Volatility Launcher to attack enemies from safe positions.</p>
