Toys - Once it
Blueprints section in menu
Each blueprint has an item description, and required mineral section
When required minerals are brought to the Molecular Assembler, CT-41 can feed it blueprints
lumene minds -> simpleton, etc

every time CT-41 sees voronash, he is darker, until he is at last absolutely black after absorbing the Outsider's Seed.

thosmodeme actually believes in the purification

worshippers buried by seismic activity caused by magma worms? seeds so ancient they are corrupted, cannot/will not join CT-41

chaotic matter

thosmodeme and voronash, ascetic martyr and gluttonous psychopath

Save tree - Root node is at the base of the screen, other nodes branches curve gently up and away. Screen is divided vertically by the number of saves on the longest branch of the tree. Player can pan and zoom through saves, and can select any to load, name or delete.

Thosmodeme becomes content to order Creation more than the Creator desires.
Vornoash wishes to break Creation apart, and destroy its order completely.


Angels are dismissive of Destroyers

Item, program, creature that analyzes enemy hp.

EVERY room will have some text available from one or more of the Companions. Even if the Companions only acknowledge their ignorance of the area, the player's experience can be enriched by their conversation.

Kozlov has seen much, and knows that the Eternal Truth is one in which CT-41 defeats Voronash.

If I can't explain an idea convincingly to myself, how can a player be expected to understand, much less share, the idea?

Destroyer response to exploration of wreck?

The game is Kozlov, searching for a Potential that could become the Eternal Truth. I have seen many truths and potentials

Outsider's father learned to alter his Child's nascent chain of memory, to spare him pain. He breaks his own chain of memory when the outsider is exiled. The Outsider alters the chains of memory of his own children as well.

What is the most outlandish, veridically paradoxical thing the player can do in this situation?

Voronash does not intend to allow for any Paradise to be made

I later learned to alter, not just the Chain, but but the Seed that surrounds it. My Master taught me much

Phantasms and false walls are matter suspended or configured, through compulsion, in an unnatural configuration
creator chooses which timeline is the correct one?

In addition to a simulator, Jessica has hidden VR tokens for CT-41 to find. She allows CT-41 to find them, but does not force him to do so. Urges him not to peak into the program where the coordinates are stored, says it ruins the fun.

VR tokens, then a simulator after being awakened

Gyoki satellite map data

No colony power after ascent? Tunneler, therfore easy navigation regardless

Broken Altar in Engineer's Locus only works once, and places CT-41 in the Outside, where it is surrounded by the Nameless before being pulled back into Creation in a flash of light.

Eclipse, rising Lumen, fully illuminated Lumen 2

Ormeil's beast called the Lost Beast

Draconids in the Badlands and on the Mountainside

Companions

Only the outsider accompanies CT-41 to Truth III.
Each Seed can be activated/deactivated. Inactive Seeds are dim, active Seeds glow.

Lineage		Name			Color		Power (each Companion adds new Visions, allows passage through Locus Doors, captured Fragments increases size of Necrolith energy meter)

Explorer	Outsider		Yellow		Empowers other Seeds, translates.
Warrior		Tribesman		Red			Shields knock back and damage enemies that touch CT-41. (shield)
Engineer	Stargazer		Blue		Adds extra laser to weapon and tool use. (weapons)
Ruler		Linguist		Purple		Adds slight sparkly telekinesis to all of CT-41's movements. (mobility)
Farmer		Groundskeeper	Green		?
Healer		Deliverer		Cyan		Greatly increases nanite colony repair rate. (health)
Laborer		Builder			Brown		?
Pet			Rascal			Blue		Distracts enemies, barks
Angel		*				White		Many and varied, do not help CT-41.

*Metatron, Chayot Ha Kodesh, Ophanim, Seraphim, Malakim, Cherubim, Ishim.

The Angels all blaze with light, yet Voronash, when he reveals himself, is in the end a being of absolute darkness, dimming and absorbing all light around him.


Can only get the Builder if you have Deliverer?
Voronash destroys all Companions but the Outsider?
No ballistic weapons?

Sands -> Huge chunk of Gateway buried east of Fortuna Crater.

"He is no god who devours his angels."

Harvest Altars
Fundamental decomposition

The Outsider

He is born into a disgraced lineage
His people are dying
He grows up alone
He is accepted by the Engineers, but is later betrayed
He flees into the Nucleus, but cannot escape fundamental truths
Discontent with the world, he kills his children to leave it, family annihilation
He cannot comprehend the Outside
He uses his new power to circumvent Creation's Law
He is praised by those who do not know him
His people are destroyed
Despairing and hopeful, he makes a deal
He serves an unknown god, and destroys the Tyrant
He leaves his dead world, to explore and conquer, regarding his victims not at all
He learns that his master, with all his power and sophistry, is ruled only by base principles
He returns to the world he killed, to die there
A stern voice calls to him, it does not compel, and it does not attempt to woo. It is a true voice.
His crimes are laid bare, the road of his penance is laid before him
He goes back as far as he can
He knows that he is weak, so he trusts another
His body dies, but the truth he now possesses does not
The truth guides another
The wicked self is killed, and all false gods cast out
The young will is broken
The old sinner accepts his punishment
His people are saved by his acts of truth, not his understanding
Creation grows ever amidst the Real



Major Changes

Fortuna Valley
Destroyer Core
Hangar is on surface, houses Destroyer artifacts gathered from across surface

Double jump should come earlier (Energy Platform)
Directional jumping causes problems (how does a down or diagonal jump work? What acts as the jumping leg)

Double jump or dash

Flipping about some object

CT-41's base does not swivel, the leg simply reverse direction at each joint

A crew member during on CT-41's birthday telling him that he doesn't need to know anything more than his immediate mission.

Strength of a force derives from the ability of two Agents to communicate with each other

Interesting interactive objects and substances

Celeste
diamonds that grant a new dash
sparkly fluid that prolongs dash

Reflective shielding, reflects lasers of particular frequencies.

Sage includes mass data for creatures encountered. Tools will contain data and formulae for their interactions with massive objects


Polymath, Volunteers, Primitives, Degenerates

Volunteers sent to look for dormant survivors of destruction in New Town
Polymath was most important to look for
Polymath does not believe CT-41, and does not join it
Degenerates are ancient, small, thin, sand dwelling Adventurer relatives, which developed in long isolation
They have been raiding New Town for supplies since the Destruction, or Great Burning as they call it
CT-41 finds the remains of several dead Explorers as trophies in the Primitive Dwellings
Like the Worshippers, Degenerates do not speak Standard Lumene, and CT-41 must have the Linguist as a companion to speak to Degenerate Seeds
Degenerates developed and practice the art of Grafting, taking the limbs and sensory organs of other creatures and incorporating them into their own bodies
Degenerates rule over the Primitives

Healers first learn to extract information from the Seeds of dead Natives
Volunteers were sent to retrieve the Seed of the Polymath, and any other Seeds, valuable objects or information from New Towm
During their journey, the Volunteers are captured by Primitives
Eventually the Volunteers become the rulers of the Primitives, and choose not to return to the Realm
The Volunteers become Degenerates, indulging in all the viscous habits of the Primitives, including Grafting

What does the Outsider do as humanity closes in around the Uraninite Vein?

CT-41 keeps each armor lode, and must wait a significant interval each time it wishes to upgrade (or downgrade) its armor?

Kozlov stays as far away from the influence of Voronash as he can, while still serving the Creator's purpose.

The Setting is the Story

A thousand lives lived in a thousand homes are CT-41's

What themes have emerged?

Purpose can be

Forced upon us
Grudgingly accepted
Chosen from among lesser options
Created to fashion the world into how we would have it

Knowledge

What is worth knowing?
What is an appropriate cost for knowledge?
Is knowledge greater than belief? Why?

Memory

Our memories are small and flawed snapshots of dead worlds. Should they guide us?


Outsider is dismissive of humans, even enhanced humans, in his conversation with CT-41.

"Through all their changes, they can never escape what they once were."
"Their thoughts and words are slow, and their minds dull. They do not remember their fathers, and have only a moment to learn. Their deaths are not to be mourned. Even the Tyrant saw them as lesser Children."
"I did not care that they died, because they already die so quickly."

When CT-41 speaks to the Oracle, it talks about how it can do so much, and yet has been designed to only act in response to requests. It does not understand how CT-41 is doing anything that it is doing.

Dark Star - Reach it by powering the Gateway at the core of the Destroyer Wreck.

Oracle tells CT-41 how it has arrived at the conclusion that the Destroyers cannot be stopped. They are only finite because they despaired of finding the Architects. When a threat rises against them and activates the Directive, they multiply beyond our capacity to comprehend. They would turn all matter into the galaxy into the Manifestation of the Directive if so provoked.


Flaws

Engineers glad the Explorers took the fall.
Rulers unwilling to punish the more useful Engineers.
Rulers unwilling to let go of their sway over the Warriors.
Warriors bound to serve Rulers, but in the end willing to die partly to be free of control.
Farmers, and Faithful especially, amiable but irritated by neighbors that upset a perfectly good system. Supportive of Rulers who preserve a functional status quo.
Healers enjoy the thought of their selflessness, and the power given to them by the Rulers over life and death.
Laborers resentful of the hand that nature and circumstance dealt them.


Voronash felt that Thosmodeme was corrupted by Creation, and that Thosmodeme had become enamoured of the limited order that the Creator imposed upon the Real. Voronash despised Thosmodeme for his contentedness living within the Creator's vision.

"The Creator's Law is petty, and his Creation is nothing but a nursery sheltering frightened children. The Real is the sum of all truth, endless and eternal. There, all things are possible. We feed our Master. He grows until he can bend the Law, and tear down the Walls, and devour the Creator that hides behind them. Then Our Master will manifest himself across the Real, sparing his Angels from Creation's downfall."

Nanite colony emergent intelligence speech. The Nanites worship CT-41 as their host and God, and do whatever they can to serve it. CT-41 provides them with lifegiving power, that was cut off when it went into sleep mode. When CT-41 awakens, the nanites are brought back to life, and preach across their many generations of the great CT-41 that carries them. The Nanite Colony first speaks to CT-41 in the Desolation, wishing to give a gift to CT-41 by modifying the Energy Shroud CT-41 just discovered. "We sustain the CT-41, as it sustains us. Its fortune is ours."

military robots no longer present in the cargo hold after deployment

we are all associates

I don't the destroyers have been challenged in a long time. In fact, I don't think they consider us to be a threat yet; we're more of a chore. If Forgive my pessimism, but if they decide we are a threat we won't stand a chance. They'll turn every atom of this galaxy into one of their constructs, and then go back to sleep.

by the direction of the lawgiver

Begin the game in truth i, with CT-41 moving up through the liquid waste tanks

Garrett has to keep the Refrigeration Deck locked.


He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made. (thosmodeme)

A burnt section of the Lower ruins, and a mound of burnt remains huddled together
Thosmodeme created many Tribute Chambers, not because he desired the Remnant's goods, but because he wanted them to live without them.

Ability to scroll the viewscreen to bounds of area (left control)

Nox and Lumen eclipse easter egg

Native killed by suicide in the Enclave. What weapon?

"I do not worship the Old Gods, but I will not contend with them either."

Only a small percentage of players should be able to enter the #GOD_AREA
Time, randomness, and no hints

God's Hide 	- Glows dully, has organic light bearing veins 
God's Veil 	- Shines around CT-41
God's Heart - Pulses with CT-41, shooting light out between the joints in its armor
God's Hoard - Shines constantly within CT-41, more brightly as it fills up
God's Light - Has a glowing surface like the Hide, shines and pulses from within like the Hoard and Heart, and shines like the Veil.

"The Self is the truth at the center of reality. Why do we teach, argue, kill, give birth? So that there is less of the Other, and more of the Self. The Creator builds his Creation in defiance of Truth, Caretaker, and Voronash will tear apart his lies."

"The Destroyers will never be as motivated as our Master."

Weakened surfacing stone in the Highway

Armors are simply added on top of each other, weight considerations and storage make no sense otherwise.

In the Basin and the Hearth are damaged and operational scanners, like the one near the Treasury, which will lock doors, pull down blast shielding, and summon enemies if CT-41 allows itself to be seen.

Necrolith menu - set Companion priority, and toggle activation.

After talking to the intelligence, CT-41 gains firing control over turrets?

"I can't activate your motor control circuits until you can get through the sim"

Hexagonal Gateway

Outsider helped to build the new Accelerator before going into hiding. Was impractical to build Gateways over any large distance.
Old and new Accelerators, new one is vertical due to energy needed to accelerate incredibly massive particle against gravity? Nope!

"Your nature aligns with my own purpose, CT-41. You will find a way: I will intervene only when I must."

Exact cause of the Pre-Tribal Extinction was unknown to Lumene Native. Many conjectured it was the result of a massive volcanic eruption, others a coronal mass ejection. Regardless, surface life was hit the hardest, but the effects of the Extinction were felt in all but the deepest regions of the Underground.

Laborers became numerous, some Rulers escaped the flooded Basin but were captured and killed.

Every subheading with a hyperlink ID gets its own links
Every subheading with a hyperlink ID will have links to its own parent page

Voronash should be a challenge, even when CT-41 is fully equipped

Destroyer wreck incredibly rugged construction, mentioned in PDR(kozlov, garrett). Paralus constructed of similar material, Destroyer Constructs highly durable.

Dialog naviagted with arrow keys: Right and left move forward and backward between prompts, shift ends
Dialog naviagted with mouse buttons: Right and left move forward and backward between prompts, shift ends

The vault is the final challenge of the game, containing one of each Material

The Cycle is long enough that CT-41 must move to all the different magma chambers, and the Underworld, to see all of the different stages of the Magma Worm lifecycle.

In most boss fights, why not let player leave? Tension or plot?

For major barriers, remove barrier permanently when destroyed.

Let areas, puzzles, aesthetic be defined by function

Enormous stone seals at the entrance to the Rulers' Locus

Clean hands and pure hearts

Thosmodeme can compel, but he wishes to change. A gun can force a man to do something, Thosmodeme wants willing Children, not witless or resentful Servants.

True prestige items, that do not improve CT-41's abilities, and are near impossible to obtain.

Paralus does a deep molecular scan first, so that nothing need be taken from CT-41

Significant, non-puzzle barriers (Sacntuary cave-in, fallen Defender), remain destroyed.
Puzzle barriers regenerate, but give access to quick workarounds after passed.

Outlaws lived in the Prospecting Camp 

Concrete in many areas of the Realm

It is trivially easy to take something, for example a human face, with which a viewer is familiar, and simply remove or alter its features to produce uncanny results. We can produce the same disgust or disquiet by looking at actual maimed or malformed humans. It is a higher goal to make a player identify with the inhuman, or be disturbed by its aspect.

Navigators: Native anti-grav transportation devices, accessible once CT-41 has Prosthetics. Unpowered Navigator(s), temporarily powered by Volt Gun
Tunneler can blink out of, but not into, fluids, due to the displacement problem. There is no cavitation problem. "We solved the cavitation problem, the displacement problem proved too difficult."
CT-41 enters the Vault from below using Tunneler, Tunneler as the primary means of exiting magma areas.
Warehouse near Factory
Magma Dock, magma lock, Pressure Vessels (docked, crashed)
New rooms within existing areas > new areas
CT-41 finding magma worm eggs, infants, children and adolescents in the cooled Laccolith and in the Prospecting Camp
Refrigeration area east of underground sea, frozen specimens
Stargazer went into dormancy, waited for friend, didn't seal up all possible Cryptfly access paths
Time compression should be a wake-up timer, date selected, screen goes black and then returns (automatic save?)
Mutated Silicates in the Razor Caverns
Time Dilation/Length Stretching item? Stretches as far as possible in the given direction?
Old, dead deep roots surrounded by cooled magma

Outsider tells CT-41 that his words go directly to his mind, and bypass any sensory equipment

Thosmodeme as the stated purpose, Voronash as the true nature. Even the ideal is evil, the truth is more so

The companions fall to the ground after the Outsider disappears

Asteroid caused the fracturing of the crust, the formation of the Volcano, and the introduction of life from the Underworld to the Deep, Shallows, and Emptiness. No coronal mass ejection.

Iconic and inorganic appearance of Thosmodeme, Artificial and calculated vs the natural, flowing and filthy Voronash

Icons of Thosmodeme throughout the Realm, placed by Laborers during the Subjugation.

Many Explorers initially supported Thosmodeme

Outsider explains he is not capable of the same as he was in life

Remove boost jet, replaced by Support

Companions (other items? No, Manigault says all technologies but the Companions have been thoroughly analyzed) confiscated by Manigault, retrieved during journey through Paralus

Companions do not join CT-41 in fights against Old Gods

Lumene piping was also a personal transport system, Explorers used to have fun seeing who could move furthest through the tubing

Thosmodeme does not simply make people feel good. He gives them the absolute certainty that they are right, and that what they do is righteous.
The Oracle and the Paralus give Manigault the same assurance.

Enemies return to areas after a certain amount of time passes, not imediately.

Mass graves visible in the soil near all of the Altars

CT-41 can query the Outsider for information at any time, rather than intervention.
Visions, however, are involuntary.

Natives consider human coloration and sight to be incredibly limited on the electromagnetic spectrum. Humans only see the "easy lights". Our colors are bland.

Pump station has filtration and water recyclying facilities.

Seven point star with one point in the center.

No more than a minute from any points in the Realm once all the Altars are discovered.

Broken Altar(s) that let a [representation] of CT-41 enter the outside to further power the Necrolith after defeating Thosmodeme's Draconids Guardians. CT-41 sees the normal objects of the Universe behind a dense curtain, but is incapable of movement. Strange phantasmic entities begin to swirl toward CT-41, and the robot must act as a turret until the broken Altar brings it back. Certain entities sit near the Tears.

No leaving the plane of the game.

Seen from the front in the Destroyer Wreck, Gateways will show the darkness of space, and then an accelerating zoom toward the Dark Star as the Gateway opens and a new Destroyer construct enters the Wreck.

Dark Star

The Outside - Broken Altar, Second Temple

5 Top-tier weapons

Chaos Weapon 		- Outside 		(Singularity, does not need to obey physical law)
God's Light 		- Chemosh 		(Old God, most powerful laser, white)
Coronal Aperture	- Torchbearer 	(Destroyer, no power requirement, plasma and radiation stream, crowd control)
Eviscerator			- ?				(Human, Deposits anti-matter at a distant point, Oracle must be able to personally control the chaotic matter)
Destroyer's Bane	- Specialists 	(Lumene Native) Designed to defeat Destroyers, taken by an Explorer into the Destroyer Wreck, special task force commissioned by Rulers, Pilot thought they quit, they died in the Destroyer Wreck.

Human name for Destroyers

I see the visions of many Potentials, and from among them choose the Truth.

The Tree of Truth was dying, and the everlasting Branch was withered.
An Enemy had entered my Garden, and poisoned its clear Waters.
The Sinner repented, and took a bright Seed to sow in a new Plot.

But still the Walls of my Garden are broken.
Its Waters are tainted, and the Enemy dwells in the Soil.
The Roots are yet twisted, and the Fruit corrupt.

Thus I choose a Gardener, who tends my feeble Sapling.
He sees its many vain Branches, and prunes them.
He casts out the Worms, and uproots the young Tree from filthy Soil.

In the blessed day the Sinner shall repair the Walls that he brake.
The Gardener shall plant the Tree in a pure and holy Plot.
Forever more shall my Tree shall bear precious fruit.

I put it together from feelings I've had
Jessica helped me to write it

I will grant you visions of what might be
And you will choose 

Kozlov has seen all that might be

Saving can only happen in Sleep Mode

Three Sleep Modes: Time, Date, Indefinite

Time sleep mode will put CT-41 to sleep for a specified period.
Date sleep mode will put CT-41 to sleep until a specific date.
Indefinite sleep mode will put CT-41 to sleep until disturbed.

The Creator speaks to CT-41 while it sleeps.

Item/Seed/Character/Quest Ideas

Item/power that passively absorbs energy to battery/necrolith
Draconid parts
Nanites changes CT-41's body based on the lifeforms it sees? Improved leg shape, spiked armor, ?
Gemstones?
Surveyors?
A particular family of Natives?
A place where collected items need to be brought?
General weapon upgrades?
Certain stones, soil, metal can only be destroyed once items have sufficient Materials?

CT-41 can only go to the Dark Star once, and must necessarily receive the Coronal Aperture.

Engineers attempting to reverse engineer an Altar attracted a Singularity and unwittingly allowed it in.

Fortress is entirely old, left over from the war.

A being that needs to be fed a certain material or flesh?

Gifts can be toggled on or off. When toggled on, only those companions necessary to grant the Gifts will leave CT-41.

CT-41 knows its gods, the first one it meets is Jessica Arai. The Creator is not a father, but a grandfather.

CT-41 must move through a colony of smaller stone giants on the Mountainside.

Along the Broken Path CT-41 must elude several Pit Assassins, and must kill at least one to reach the Destroyer Wreck.

Instead of moving down the Broken Path, CT-41 can also visit the wreckage of the Spaceport. Much of the port was damaged by the impact of the Destroyer Wreck, and has been filled with sand. The eastern most region has been obliterated all the way down through the foundations.

Outlaws

When CT-41 enters Sleep Mode, its awareness recedes, and another awareness takes over. This awareness is able to choose to look down different paths, to see how they end, or if they end. Eventually the awareness finds a path that results in CT-41 defeating Voronash, and realizing Truth III.

Player has the option to 'Watch' rather than load or save.

Suborganisms, imperfect Seeds, half children, designed to serve, not to carry on the genetic legacy. Men, without gonads.

Data page for each item, including current numbers (dmg, projectile speed, energy drain, etc.)

Analyzer, shows boss/enemy health

Do not make return journeys more difficult to execute than exploration journeys

A series of timed races (Training Grounds in the Frontier)

Did Well

Caterpillar Map Overlay (Intelligence, Oracle, CI-CI, Scanning Report, Gyoki Satellite)

Complete Map image, no misleading dark edges that lead nowhere.

When CT-41 enters the Crystal Caverns, the Outsider mentions that the Companions are all feeling strange vibrations.

For a given room, all, any or none of the Companions may have something to say.

Downloadable techniques?

What would a Caretaker Colonial Assistant be designed to do? After designing basic hardware, how could that hardware be utilized?

Wheeled legs, large body cavity for holding tools, two double-jointed tool attachments, two wheeled legs, running lights, access ports, basic sensory equipment.
A pair of robitic hands hanging in Jessica's room.

The Challenger is an older piece of technology, less elegant than the Executors but no less deadly, due to its over-engineering

Faster wheel allows for faster wall climbing (pushing against wall and spinning wheel)

High Grip Wheels improve wall climbing as well

Need a plausible design for Caretaker, emphasis on mobility

Talk to Luke about wheeled jumping
Motors are heavy, we want them proximal

"Scare the local wildlife away. If you're attacked, use the laser to defend yourself. I'll be monitoring your progress here."

Oracle doesn't lament the fact that it can't act when asked by CT-41.

Photon Buckler - Arc shape, reflects projectiles and beams. Photonic Molecules to increase shield width and damage. Deals damage to enemies that touch it, but does not apply impulses to them or CT-41. Good for close range combat as a melee weapon and for running through crowds of weak enemies, good for longe range combat against beam and particle emitting foes.

Base of CT-41 rotates with left and right button presses. Arms rotate to follow mouse. Sensor dome swivels based on left/right direction of mouse. Wheel, body, and dome are physical, legs and arms are visual only.

Power source for Sanctuary is repurposed Native power supply, available to CT-41 after Voronash ravages Sanctuary.

Electricity generating creatures enslaved by Degenerates and Primitives.

Agents are the Law. Wherever the Law appears, and whatever level it appears at, there are Agents.

Miners in the badlands awakened an Old God, and perished.

Degenerates and Primitives wear pieces of othe animals, grafted limbs, and carry pieces of scavenged structure from the Starbase as signs of prestige.

The Slums within the Settlement come before the Badlands where the Outlaws lived.

Natives gave up developing artificial intelligence, instead opting for the reuse and reanimation of their crystaline minds.

CT-41 abilities

Move up or down to move between tall and short extremes.
Tall mode allows for significantly superior jumping.
Short mode allows for slightly superior speed, and passage through narrow areas.
If pressing against a wall with Maneuvering Jets, wheels can spin, slowly moving CT-41 up straight walls.

Controls

During gameplay

Up-Down: Change CT-41 height
Right-Left: Swivel leg direction, engage wheels
Space: Jump
L Mouse, R Mouse: Use primary, secondary tools
Shift: Communicate, interface
F: Inventory screen

During comunnication

Space: Skip current dialog
Shift: Skip all dialog

During control

Up, down, left, right, space, l mouse, r mouse: Situational
Shift: Revert control to CT-41

CT-CA models were not designed for speed or agility like some other models. CTs for the most part were designed to carry and manage tools.

Several domesticated animal varieties turned feral.

Natives didn't understand Destroyer ship movements, they remained stationary over the planet without needing to orbit.

Remember, Forget, Witness (Save, Delete, Load)

Outsider: I commanded many strange powers when I held natural Selves captive. As I am, I will no longer weild these powers, even to do good.

Rulers commissioned the Outsider to construct more Altars after the first few that he revealed.

Linguist comments that things have changed since he was last there.

Silicates living in different material environments form crystals of different strucures, sizes, shapes and colors.

Load from most recent save immediately upon death.

Wind based power generation.

Healers responsible for cybernetic enhancements of lumene organisms

Make lesser items requisite for God items

God's Heart	- CT-41 must focus a particular weapon for a long time
God's Hoard - CT-41 must use the Medusa, along with a large amount of battery, to Petrify a large creature
God's Light - CT-41 must use a blue laser to get past some obstacle
God's Hide	- CT-41 must have sufficient armor to withstand something? Maybe don't pick up inferior armors?
God's Veil	- CT-41 must have a powerful enough shield to pass through the magma of the Underworld

Floodlights and periodic sirens to scare away native lifeforms (Scarecrows)

Paralus crew is uninterested in Destroyer wreckage, humanity has already encountered plenty

Scarecrows silent and without light after the Blackout, lumene lifeforms present in and around the Colony

Sonic Auger should be in a supply closet.

Fortuna Valley rather than Crater, Pre-Tribal Extinction the result of an eruption that radically disturbed the surface life and for several Turns diverted the Migration

Ground Seeds mixed with resin from false dormancy to produce glow stones and glowpaint

CT-41 finds high grip treads (oil slicks, ice, wall-jump) in the Hall of Relics

Grafting was practiced by several ancient tribes, but was outlawed in the first Great Council

Voronash, and Thosmodeme, gain more sentience and selfhood the more Selves they consume
