				<p>CT-41 moves east toward lip of the Fortuna Crater, but finds nothing of interest other than a small shack, and an elevated pad where Jumpers from the Hangar once landed. CT-41 turns west, and crosses a short meadow before beginning to move up the gently rolling Foothills at the base of the Mountainside. These hills are perennial homes to many hard Lumene creatures, which enter Dormancy when conditions do not favor them. During the Lumene dusk and dawn are also inhabited by the autotrophs, grazers, hunters and scavengers that accompany the Migration. Depending on the season of the Turn, CT-41 may encounter several different biomes in the Foothils.</p>

				<p>Near the top of the Foothills CT-41 encounters the first of several camps, small dens of safety and recovery carved into the Mountainside. CT-41 finds one camp in each of the zones through which it passes. At the center of each camp is a comforting fire that continually and inexplicably burns as the Turns pass.</p>

				<p>As CT-41 moves up out of the Foothills and into the Slopes, its journey becomes more difficult. CT-41 will need to use precise jumps and the clever placement of stones to progress. The seasons become also important to CT-41's progress at this point. Throughout the Slopes CT-41 encounters ponds and lakes, and small openings into shallow caves and fissures the Mountainside. During the day, all water is evaporated. At night, all water is frozen into ice. During dawn and dusk, liquid water is present. All seasonal bodies of water are accompanied by clear markings on surrounding rock, showing the typical water level. CT-41 must compress time over and over to continue upward, changing the season to modify its environment.</p>

				<p>After it clears the Slopes, CT-41 reaches the Crags, and the environment changes again. The rocks here are sharp, and damage CT-41 if it becomes falls or runs into them carelessly. There are great chasms that open up before it. The seasonal weather patterns also grow more severe, and CT-41 begins to deal with howling winds, mist, snow, and incredible heat. The lifeforms here are increasingly robust and deadly, and furiously attack CT-41 as it enters their territory.</p>

				<p>The puzzles that present themselves on the Mountainside are many and varied, and a few are listed here.</p>

				<div class="indented-list">

					<p>CT-41 must allow Lumen to evaporate water from a pond, in order to gain speed for a jump.</p>

					<p>CT-41 must allow pond to freeze, in order to stand on its surface for a jump.</p>

					<p>CT-41 must compress time until the dusk or dawn, in order to use a migratory creature as a stepping stone.</p>

					<p>CT-41 encounters a hanging stone barrier dipping down into a pool. It cannot cross at night, since the ice and the hanging barrier prevent passage, or during the day, because it cannot jump up onto the western ledge from the exposed floor of the pool. It instead uses the Turbine to leap out of the western edge of the pool onto dry ground.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">A Great Heap Of Stones</div>

				<p>At the top of the Crags CT-41 enters a wide stone cavity, whose western edge is too high to climb. Near the eastern edge of the cavity is a suspicious formation of stones, similar in appearance to the Rockhides that CT-41 has encounter on the Slopes and throughout the Crags. The Stone Giant does not awaken during the night or day, but during the rainy dawn and dusk it will emerge, and attack CT-41.</p>

				<p>At dusk and dawn this upper region of the Crags is under constant rainfall, and frequent lightning casts stark shadows over the battlefield. The Stone Giant is a simple but highly effective foe, a large omnivore that has covered itself in large purposeful slabs of rock. IT crushes CT-41 whenever it gets the chance, and will hurl boulders at it, dealing high kinetic damage and knockback. CT-41 takes advantage of the rare moments when the Stone Giant's innards are exposed to attack it with high damage attacks, such as blasts from the Scattershot and bolts from the Volatility Launcher.</p>

				<p>As it dies, the Stone Giant lets out a final roar, and several of the large stones that encase it fall away. CT-41 gathers these, and piles them at the western edge of the combat area. CT-41 leaps to the top of this makeshift altar, and emerges from the Stone Giant's lair into the Clearing.</p>

				<small>"And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem."</small>
