				<div class="entry-section-title">The Valley Which Was Full Of Bones</div>

				<p>CT-41 enters the Argo via the eastern ramp, and finds its interior greatly changed from when the lander touched down. The storage decks are mostly empty, and none of the human crew are present. There is evidence of battle; the walls of the Bulk Storage Deck are scarred, and the skeletons of several Marines are present. CT-41 moves through the Argo, but cannot find any living members of the crew. The doors to the Command and Hibernation Decks do not open.</p>
				
				<p>CT-41 exits the Argo via its large western bay door, and moves across the floor of the Fortuna Crater. A short distance past the Argo the ground is no longer paved, but it has obviously been leveled, and is covered in loose crushed rock. As it moves along the Valley floor, CT-41 sees several Scarecrows, tall towers topped by powerful floodlights which occasionally produce loud and threatening screeches and bellows designed to frighten and scatter native Lumene creatures.</p>

				<p>CT-41 continues westward, and enters a Guardhouse with an open rolling door at its eastern end, large enough to allow vehicles to pass through. The Guardhouse is the eastern entrance to a fenced section of the Valley floor. The fence is topped with razor wire, has signs indicating it is electrified, and surrounds a layered depression in the ground. This is an open Pit Mine, where abundant meteoric iron was extracted from near the surface of Lumen 2. Tailings and overburden mounds can be seen in the distance. At the center of the basin CT-41 enters the head frame of a shaft Mine, which contains a large and rugged cargo skip. CT-41 is able to use this skip arbitrarily, moving up and down and stopping wherever it desires. Each level in the Mine contains a simple control panel, near the main shaft, that CT-41 can use to summon the skip.</p>
				
				<p>Before exploring the tunnels of the Mine, CT-41 continues west on the surface, and finds another Guardhouse. This Guardhouse is much smaller than the first, and at its western end is a door that CT-41 cannot open. Large floodlights from a Scarecrow atop the Guardhouse shine out into the western half of the Valley.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Dig Now Into The Wall</div>
				
				<p>CT-41 returns to the head frame, moves onto the skip and guides it down. The Upper Levels of the Mine are well lit, and dry. Wiring runs along the ceiling of each level, chaining together the lights. Some of the levels are producing, some are back filled, and others are exploratory. Within the Mine CT-41 finds several supply rooms containing mining and personal equipment. The Mine's ore tunnels have railed floors, and some of the producing levels have minecarts, which CT-41 can push. The carts can only be pushed onto the skip if it locks into position at the level of the cart. No Lumene lifeforms are present in the Upper Levels of the Mine.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">At the base of the Upper Levels CT-41 finds a long tunnel, heading east toward the Colony, that is larger and more obviously permanent than the other tunnels CT-41 has explored. This tunnel has a railed floor like all the others, and ends at a door leading to the Ironworks. CT-41 attempts to open the door, but when it does so is told <em>"Access denied."</em></p>
				
				<p>CT-41 boards the skip, and moves down to the next shaft, which heads west. This is an exploratory shaft, and other than flickering lighting, no permanent fixtures are present. As CT-41 moves west, it comes to a drop-off and moves over the edge. Unfortunately, it is unable to jump back up to the ledge. Trapped, CT-41 moves deeper into the unfinished shaft, and finds a Sonic Auger left abandoned in the dirt at the end. The Auger has a cautionary note attached.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Laminated Note: <em>"1) This is the only one we've found: Do not lose it."</em></p>
				<p class="character-dialog">Laminated Note: <em>"2) We don't know how it works, and we don't know how to fix it: Do not drop it."</em></p>
				<p class="character-dialog">Laminated Note: <em>"3) Kowalski is deaf because of this thing: Do not point it at anything with ears."</em></p>
				<p class="character-dialog">Laminated Note: <em>"4) If command finds out about this thing they will give it to the eggheads: Do not talk about it."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 equips the Sonic Auger, and finds that it can be used to scatter and dissipate loose soil. CT-41 moves east to the ledge, and scatters the loose soil at its lip, allowing it to jump up and return to the main shaft of the Mine.</p>
				
				<p>CT-41 enters the skip again, and heads downward. There is a long gap between the Upper and Lower Levels of the Mine, and CT-41 sees the layered composition of the Lumen 2's crust as it descends. CT-41 discovers that all but two of the tunnels in the Lower Levels face east, toward a dense vein of dark metallic ore. The lights have gone out in the very lowest tunnels. Pooled water is present at the bottom of the main shaft and on the uneven floors of the tunnels that head east and west from the main shaft. A few scattered Lumene creatures have made their homes in the lower levels of the Mine near water, and they attack CT-41 if it enters their territory.</p>

				<p>CT-41 enters the tunnel that leads west, and sees that a large cave-in has occurred there. The tunnel is filled with broken rock, and is currently impassable. CT-41 then enters the tunnel leading east, and finds an exploratory drilling leading downward. CT-41 enters this dark hole, and falls into several feet of water. Moving to the end of the tunnel, CT-41 finds a patch of loose soil, and scatters it with the Sonic Auger. Buried under the soil CT-41 finds the environment suit and skeletal remains of a human. With the remains are a PDR and a Recruit's Rank Card. CT-41 reads the PDR, and discovers that the remains are those of Recruit Abelino Montes, a Mine worker.</p>
				
				<p>With the Recruit's Rank Card, CT-41 is able to open the door to the Ironworks near the base of the Upper Levels. CT-41 passes by the large crushing, rolling, and forging machinery in the Ironworks, and passes through into the Machine Shop. In the Machine Shop CT-41 sees lathes, mills, and a drill presses, laser cutters and other tools.</p>

				<p>Sitting on one of the workbenches in the Machine Shop is a piece of Steel Stock, which CT-41 picks up. The Steel Stock is placed in one of CT-41's item slots, and an empty meter appears beneath it. As CT-41 continues to move through the Machine Shop, strange messages begin to appear, separated by short pauses. If CT-41 does not pick up the Steel Stock, the following dialog will occur whenever it first acquires an item that is incompatible with its system.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>[...]</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>[Do we dare?]</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>[...]</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>[Yes, we must!]</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>[...]</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>[We prostrate ourselves you, our great and moving God! Please, do not punish us for our hubris!]</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Hello. Who is speaking to me?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>[It has heard us! Rejoice!]</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Who are you?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>[Forgive us our presumptuousness, your Immensity. We your subjects have only broken our silence to serve you... Not that that you need our help, of course! We simply wish to express the depth of our devotion through deeds!]</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I am confused. Where are you?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>[Does it not remember us? It knows all things, surely this is a test... It would have us speak the words, that we may know them truly... Great moving God, we dwell inside you, and upon you. You are our world! You bear us through the Beyond, and we are all sworn to serve you. We repair you when you become damaged... It's not a hassle, we love repairing you!]</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"You are my nanites?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Nanites: <em>[It calls us 'Nanites'; by the moving God we are named! ...Yes, O Great One, we meek servants shall be your Nanites!]</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"How are you speaking to me? How do you think at all?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Nanites: <em>[Did you not create us in the beginning? And did you not raise us from the darkness of the Long Night to serve you again? Why do you ask us such questions?]</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"No, I did not create you. You were given to me by a human named Ines Orozco."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Nanites: <em>[Blessed Ines, the Holy Orozco, let her name be praised! Praise!]</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I still do not understand how you are capable of thought, much less speech."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Nanites: <em>[When we are alone, we are foolish and stupid beings. We obey the Law, but we do not understand it. We act, but we do not truly see. But when many of us are joined together, the true Servant emerges: we understand the world, our debt to you and Blessed Ines, and our purpose...]</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Nanites: <em>[The Law tells us to serve you, and mend you when you are wounded, but when we became wise we no longer needed the Law to guide us. For you, great moving God, are the source of our life, and we will sustain you as you sustain us! From you flows the spark that animates us, and without you we are nothing. We shudder at the memory of the Long Night, yet we take comfort in the resurrection of our God from that dark sleep of death!]</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"You said earlier that you had nothing to offer me, until now. What do you offer me?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Nanites: <em>[Long ago you acquired a strange Relic. We have spent many Journeys studying the Relic, just as we have studied you. We discovered that we can adapt the Relic for your use, but we dare not alter it without your permission, and your blessing!]</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"You have my permission and my blessing, Nanites."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Nanites: <em>[Then we shall set forth upon this great work! Though many generations shall pass ere our toils end, we shall yet render unto you a worthy gift! May the Orozco guide us in our labors until we speak again!]</em></p>

				<p>Over a period of several hours, which CT-41 can compress, the Nanites adapt the Steel Stock into the Steel Plating. When their work is complete, they speak to CT-41 again.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Nanites: <em>[Our work is finished, and we humbly present our gift to you! If ever you find another such Relic, we shall change it, that it might be worthy of you!]</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Thank you for your gift, Nanites."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Nanites: <em>[You shame us with your gratitude, great moving God. Truly we are nothing before you, the Power which bears us in its colossal bosom through the Beyond. We cannot hope to repay our debt to you. We, the humble Nanites of the Immensity, will return to our lowly works, and cherish your words forever!]</em></p>

				<p>The Nanites end their conversation with CT-41, who equips their modified 'Relic'. In its inventory menu, CT-41 inspects its new Steel Plating, and sees that its integrity has increased by 100 percent, to 40 percent of the maximum.</p>
				
				<p>At the eastern end of the Machine Shop, CT-41 uses the Recruit's Rank Card to call down and operate the cargo elevator that moves between the Machine Shop and the Garage. Back in the Colony, CT-41 can access any of its computer consoles. When it does so, CICI will inform CT-41 of her recent actions.
				
				<p>CICI: <em>"I have transmitted your updated sensor logs and acquisition analyses to Earth via Bulk Data Transfer."</em></p>
