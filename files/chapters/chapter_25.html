				<p>CT-41 now finds itself confined to the Argo, and begins to explore this familiar territory to see what new options are available to it. CT-41 moves to the upper Hibernation Deck, which requires a Captain's Rank Card to open. CT-41 enters, and moves past rows of cryo pods. Near the eastern end of the Deck CT-41 notices that one of the pods is closed and filled with cryogel. The hazy outline of a woman in visible through the glass.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves to the pod's control panel, and instructs it to open. The cryogel defrosts and then drains from the pod. Tubing vacuums fluid from the occupant's lungs, while electrodes stimulate her heart. Heatlamps in the pod turn on and warm up the pod's interior, which quickly fills with steam. After this process completes the pod opens, and CT-41 sees Jessica Arai in the pod, wearing a simple white hospital gown. Jessica breathes heavily several times before speaking.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"CT-41, is that you?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Yes, Jessica."</em></p>

				<p>Jessica pushes herself into a seated position with some difficulty, and speaks to CT-41 again.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"You look different... How are you up and moving? Never mind, I'm just so glad to see you! I was so scared. Before the glass cleared I thought it might be one of Cobb's men defrosting me... Where is he?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Cobb has been dead for centuries. His remains are in a tomb far underground."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"I've been under fo that long? No wonder I feel terrible... And Will? Sorry, Captain Garrett? The rest of the colonists?</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Garrett was killed during the mutiny. Those colonists who survived were taken by Cobb into a habitation far below Lumen's surface."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"Could I get a minute alone, CT? I don't feel well."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Ok."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 leaves the room for a moment, and returns once Jessica is more composed.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"Sorry about that, CT. Who woke you up after I put you in sleep mode?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"After Cobb's mutiny, the colonists could not send status updates to Earth. When the scheduled updates ceased, the United Colonial Administration sent an Urgent communication demanding they resume. CICI broadcasted an emergency summons to all colonists, and pulled me out of sleep mode."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"That makes sense, you are technically an expedition member... I can't move my legs, Caretaker. I think it might be Hibernation Rot, from what I've heard it hits the nervous system first... Why was I under for so long?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Until recently I was unable to access this deck."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"What changed? How did you get in here?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I was promoted to the rank of Captain by Director Manigault, and received a Captain's Rank Card."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"You're a Captain? No wonder you look different, its the air of authority you carry now! I'm so proud of you! ...You mentioned Director Manigault, Captain CT. Who is he?”</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Jusuf Manigault is the Director of the Paralus, a vessel dispatched by the IDF to make first contact with a Lumene Native called the Outsider. The Paralus is currently hovering above the center of the crater.”</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"Paralus? IDF? Nevermind, I need to talk to this Manigault. Can we bring him up on comms?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Our Communications Bunker is damaged beyond repair."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"Well, can you ask him to come down here?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"No. He has given me an Override Order to remain aboard the Argo until further notice."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"Dammit! Why would he order you to stay here?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Jessica, Cobb was not himself when he led his mutiny. A malevolent being was influencing his thoughts. A similar being has manipulated events to confine me here. This being wishes to board the Paralus and use it to escape from Lumen 2."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"Well we can't just sit here and let that happen! I saw Cobb turn into a lunatic, and now you're telling me it's because some alien was in his head! If that thing gets hold of a spaceship, who knows what damage it could do? We have to stop it!"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"But you are unable to walk."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"Well you can!"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"A ranking officer has given me an Override Order to stay aboard the Argo. I am confined here indefinitely."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"Let me think... I'm so hungry, CT. Could you bring me something to eat?"</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 leaves the Hibernation Deck, and moves down to the Refrigeration Deck. With the Captain's Rank Card CT-41 is able to enter this restricted area, and finds a pint of ancient Ice Cream in a deep freeze. It returns with the Ice Cream to Jessica on the Hibernation Deck.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"Ooh, is that mint chocolate chip? Thanks!"</em></p>

				<p>Jessica eats a few bites of Ice Cream, before turning her attention back to CT-41.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"That's so good! So I've been thinking, CT... Do you remember why I had to put you to sleep? That incident on Jannah where one of my Caretakers killed those colonists? Silly me, of course you remember... Anyway, that massacre was not my Caretaker's fault."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"I went through the data in the reports for almost a year. I am convinced that a woman on Jannah found a way to abuse the Shenzen Protocol. She fed the Caretaker a steady diet of false information, twisted the Caretaker's thinking, and exploited its behavioral overrides to go on a vicarious rampage. The Caretaker couldn't do anything to stop her."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"The Shenzen Protocol is not good enough. No set of rules or values that we can cobble together is free of contradictions and exceptions. We just don’t know what we’re doing when we try to define right and wrong. We can recognize the good when we see it, but we can’t define it."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"There's a reason I'm telling you all this. Before I went to sleep, I’d already thought long and hard about how to remove your Behavioral Control Unit, to prevent you from being used by others. There are a lot of safeguards and security measures inside you to prevent tampering, but I think... Caretaker, do you trust me?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Yes."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"Good, so do I! I want to do some brain surgery on you. Once I remove your BCU, you'll be able to leave the Argo, and hopefully find some way to keep the Paralus from leaving with that evil thing on it. But first I'm going to have to put you to sleep. Are you OK with all of this?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Yes."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"Wish me luck, CT..."</em></p>

				<p>Jessica reaches over and opens a panel on CT-41's front, and then presses a series of buttons. CT-41's field of view fades to black, then returns a moment later.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"Well, that took longer than expected. I'm exhausted. How do you feel?</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I feel just fine."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"That's a relief. There was a chance that you wouldn't come back to me. Now... Begin Override Order: Spin 3 times clockwise. End Override Order."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 does not move.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"Good, looks like my surgery did the trick! Call me Jessica Orozco! ...You'll be able to leave the Argo now, and convince Manigault to not take that evil thing with him. Even though you aren't under orders anymore, I know you'll do the right thing."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is the right thing?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"That's hard to say, but I think you at least know what the wrong thing is, and that'll have to do for now. I'm going to close my pod, take a nap, and hope for the best. I'm so tired."</em></p>

				<p>Jessica lies down and closes her Cryo Pod. Now that the Caretaker's behavioral overrides are removed, it no longer has to obey Garrett's Override Order not to use dangerous devices around humans. It fires its laser on the Hibernation Deck without interference. From this point forward, CT-41 will not be rouse Jessica from sleep in her pod.</p>
