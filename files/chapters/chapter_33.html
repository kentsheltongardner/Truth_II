				<p>CT-41 returns to the Altar near the Menagerie, and begins to explore the Warriors' Locus and the Hunting Grounds using its new items. New avenues of exploration open up, and the Companion recounts much of the Lumene past.</p>

				<p>As CT-41 explores the lower regions of the Hunting Grounds, it returns to a winding passageway which was previously impassable. A number of large stones have fallen from the roof of the tunnel, blocking it completely. With the Impact Cannon, CT-41 blasts the stones apart, and enters the Cave-in. This isolated area is devoid of life, as it is sealed off from the rest of the Underground, and lacks any sustainable source of food or fresh air. The torn remains of Beast and Natives can be seen littering the floor of several caverns, some still intertwined in combat. The entire region of the Cave-in is geologically unstable. Rocks and soil fall easily from the ceilings, and certain floors fall out from under the unwary. CT-41 finds a chamber that was once a communal Beasts' den deeper in the Cave-in, and pieces of several Warriors and Explorers in a large trophy pit.</p>

				<p>CT-41 continues downward, and finally enters a long hallway with a low ceiling leading east. CT-41 moves to the edge of a small drop-off, and jumps over a large stone positioned next to the rock face. CT-41 moves through the passage, and eventually discovers that the tunnel is a dead end, terminating in a pit lined with enormous tusks and spikes. As CT-41 nears the end of the tunnel, the ground begtins to shake, as a Lumene Warrior charges toward it from near the entrance to the tunnel. The Warrior rams into CT-41 and attacks it relentlessly, trying to force it backward into the spiked pit. CT-41 is trapped in a battle where it can't maneuver around its opponent, and must do what it can to dodge attacks in limited space. The Warrior is equipped with primitive armor, and owing to the Native's size and ferocity, the battle is not an easy one for CT-41, in spite of its technological advantage.</p>

				<p>After a fierce battle the Warrior is defeated, and falls to the ground dead. As CT-41 moves toward his body, the Companion speaks, and says that communication with the Warrior's Seed is possible. The Companion advises CT-41 that communication with the Warrior may be difficult.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"This was a Warrior of the Tribal Age, one of the Kindred. Perhaps if we speak to him he will join you in your quest, as I have joined you. His is an ancient dialect, a relic of his time. I once spoke this language, and I will translate your thoughts to the Warrior as best I can. If he is willing, I will empower his Seed to join us, and let him hear and see as you do."</em></p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">I Have Fought A Good Fight</div>

				<p>CT-41 moves toward the body of the Warrior, and speaks to its Seed.</p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Hello, noble Warrior."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Raider: <em>"Thy flattery is wasted on me! Show thyself! Wherefore dost thou hide in darkness?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I speak words to your mind, which lives in your Seed. I fought with you, and prevailed. Why did you attack me?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Raider: <em>"I attacked thee because thou art neither scout nor soldier, and art perchance some strange creature of this land. When my band became trapped in these caves, prey and forage became scarce. The beasts that dwelt here grew desparate and bold, for they greatly outnumbered us. They came out against us in packs (for we are nigh unto their nest), and they slew many of my brethren. Fearing a shameful end, we rallied against the beasts, and slaughtered all them of the nest."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"After our battle, I alone remained of my band. For much time I ate the rotting flesh of dead beasts, and searched for some escape. When my food and strength were spent, I made ready my snare. Then placed I myself in the deep sleep, awaiting some new happening. Thou entered in, and as I knew thee not, I came at thee with violence. Yet where art thou, and where am I?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I am standing in front of you, but you cannot see me, because your body is destroyed."</em></p> 

				<p class="character-dialog">Raider: <em>"So I am defeated... The mystics spake truth then, when they said that the life of the Seed is more than the life of the flesh... I cannot move, and I cannot see, but I do remember our battle... Among my people I am considered mighty, yet by thee was I bested rightly. I have never known a creature so strange as thou art, nor so powerful. How dost thou speak to the dead?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I am aided by a translator, one of your kind. Know this: Even though I killed you, I am your friend. My enemy is yours also."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Raider: <em>"Dost thou also war against the weak farmers, and their cousins come up from the deeps?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I do not. You will have many questions, and my translator can answer them better than I. Much has happened since you went to sleep. But I have a request of you."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Raider: <em>"I am honorably beaten, and thou givest me no cause to doubt thy intent. What wilt thou of me?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I want you to join me in my travels, and in my battles against my enemies, and your enemies."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Raider: <em>"Though I am ever eager for battle, it is a dishonor for the Seed to be moved from its resting place. 'For a Warrior's Seed shall lie forever where he fell, as a testament to his battle.'"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"But you are not yet dead, are you? This need not be your last battle, nor your resting place."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Raider: <em>"Thou speakest the truth, yet how shall I join thee? For my flesh is broken; how shall I move? My lights are gone out; how yet shall I see?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"My translator will empower you, to observe, and to act. You will rise out of your body, and see through my eyes."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Raider: <em>"I would receive this gift of thee, and aid thee in thy warfare."</em></p>

				<p>The Necrolith empowers the Seed of the Raider, and it moves out of its body. It joins CT-41, and follows it just as the Necrolith does. The Necrolith gains the ability to link with the Seed of the Raider, and occasionally emits a powerful radial pulse, which knocks back enemies that try to swarm CT-41.</p>

				<p>As CT-41 leaves the tunnel, it notices that the stone in front of the rock face has been moved forward, revealing a recess containing a resinous shell in the shape of the Raider.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">The Beasts Go Into Dens</div>

				<p>CT-41 leaves the Cave-In, and moves west through the Hunting Grounds it explored long ago. The Hunting Grounds are depopulated, like much of the area under the Fortuna Crater. CT-41 continues west, into a long tunnel where rows of sharpened stones have been deliberately placed to keep intruders out. CT-41 uses its many tools to navigate past the sharp stones, and enters a large region of the Wild called the Beasthome.</p>

				<p>Unlike most other regions of the Underground, the Beasthome has not been scoured of life. CT-41 explores the interconnected chambers of the Beasthome, and finds many Beast dens, and Beastlings, Beasts, and enormous Behemoths. These Behemoths are fully mature Beasts, capable of challenging even CT-41. At the center of the Beasthome is a large chamber, the Hall Of Reckoning, which is patrolled by several Beasts and a Behemoth. CT-41 moves through the Hall quickly, and begins to explore the various dens connected to it.</p>

				<p>Dens in the Beasthome resemble the Beast Den in the Caverns, and typically have pools, clawed stones, and trophy pits. After defeating a Behemoth in one of the dens, CT-41 moves into its trophy pit, where it finds pieces of a Warrior's exoskeletal components, and a Native weapon. The Nanite Colony adapts the weapon, a Scattershot, for CT-41's use. The Scattershot blasts out many superheated projectiles in a cone, and is excellent for close range or confined combat, and for battles against large groups of foes.</p>

				<p>Below and to the east of the Beasthome CT-41 finds their exclusive hunting grounds, where weaker Lumene organisms live and breed. In several bubbling pools CT-41 finds an ecosystem built on vine-like growths which dangle from ceilings, and float up from the bottoms of lake, terminating in clusters of translucent bulbous nodes. Herbivores of various sizes graze on vegetation large and small, and CT-41 recognizes many of the novel creatures it sees here, after seeing their remains in Beasts' trophy pits.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">A Great Sacrifice Unto Dagon</div>

				<p>After cataloging the strange lifeforms of the far Wild, CT-41 returns to the Hall Of Reckoning, and moves up into through a wide tunnel into a new region of the Wild. There is frequent gore on smeared or scraped across the walls. Life is sparse here, and is limited to insignificant vegetation and small flying and creeping things incapable of even pestering CT-41. CT-41 continues upward, passing a Beast that stands as a watchman, and enters a huge open cavern.</p>

				<p>In front of CT-41 is a heaping, stinking mound of flesh, and swarms of small carrion feeders. Hard remains litter the floor. Soon after CT-41 enters the chamber and begins to crunch its way across the floor, an Old God, Dagon, emerges from the eastern end of the chamber. Dagon is the only Old God that is not Dormant when CT-41 first encounters it. There are no resinous pieces of a Dormancy shell in Dagon's abode.</p>

				<p>Dagon is covered in thick, luminescent armor, scarred and pitted from battles in the ancient past. It roars its challenge to CT-41, and charges forward. Regardless of what weaponry CT-41 employs, it can only deal minimal damage to Molech if it targets the God's armor. CT-41 will need to carefully and repeatedly strike the gluttonous monstrosity between its heavy armor plates.</p>

				<p>After a prolonged and calculated battle, Dagon's flesh withers, and with an anguished howl it slumps to the floor of its cavern. CT-41 approaches its carcass, and takes its gleaming Seed. The Nanite Colony adapts the Seed into the God's Hide, an astonishingly strong, dully glowing armor which increases CT-41's Integrity to a maximum.</p>

				<p>As CT-41 leaves the Beasthome, the Beastlings, Beasts and Behemoths that live there no longer attack it, and instead bow down either out of fear or gratitude. Even if CT-41 attacks them, the Beasts will not respond with violence, and will instead hunker down into a defensive stance beneath their armor plating.</p>

				<small>"And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon."</small>
