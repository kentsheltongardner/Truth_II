				<p>CT-41 falls into the far eastern chamber of the Upper Root Fields, which are a linear series of warm, humid chambers with low ceilings. Before exploring the Root Fields, CT-41 journeys east and enters a series of natural caverns marked by large and ornate feeders. Within this region are the dead husks and dormant shells of many Sapsuckers, as well as various other creatures. Wild Deep Root growths are present, and some have overgrown the feeders, but they are fairly sparse. CT-41 finds a chamber filled with cutting tools, tables, buckets, and drains. Here the crumbling exoskeletal remains of many Sapsuckers and other creatures hang from the walls and from racks on the ceiling.</p>

				<p>CT-41 explores the tunnels of this region, once called the 'Fly Traps' by Lumene Natives, and finds a Farmer's vial of Superconductors hidden in a small chamber connected to his overgrown habitation. This Material is for the moment an enigma to CT-41, but as it is clearly a valuable item, the curious robot takes it nonetheless.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves up to the top of the Fly Traps, into a remote and hidden chamber. Within CT-41 finds an Altar, overgrown by a Deep Root. Although the Altar is currently unpowered, CT-41 senses its importance, as its stark appearance is striking against the backdrop of its chamber. CT-41 destroys the Deep Root, which does not grow back, and clears the Altar.</p>

				<p>Deep in the Fly Traps CT-41 finds another Watcher, this time undamaged. CT-41 pursues and destroys the Watcher, which drops a salvageable item. The Nanite Colony adapts the item into the Electron Sensor, which detects environmental objects and enemies that respond favorably to strikes from the Volt Gun.</p>

				<p>CT-41 then leaves the region of the Fly Traps, and moves down, deep into the crust of Lumen 2. It eventually runs into two large statues of Lumene Natives, each holding a primitive weapon in a defensive stance. Though these statues once flanked the vertical passageway, the western statue has fallen across the tunnel's span and broken, blocking the way. CT-41 tries to use the Sonic Auger to dislodge the cracked statue, but the tool has no effect. CT-41 leaves this dead end and moves back up, but not before placing a marker on its Map to return later and investigate the region further.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">A Branch Shall Grow Out Of His Roots</div>
				<!--
				His roots are wrapped about the heap

				-->

				<p>CT-41 moves back into the Root Fields, and heads west. Many drip spikes hang from the roofs of the caverns, and grates cover tubing leading to large cisterns where water boils and rises from near the Magma Chamber below. The drip spikes and boiling water will damage CT-41 if it comes into contact with them. The floor is marked by small holes into which Deep Roots have penetrated and begun to take hold. Translucent, bulbous nodes have formed on many of the Deep Roots. CT-41 observes the Deep Root ecosystem, with small herbivores and parasites leeching Flow from the Deep Roots, predators preying upon the weak, and scavengers feeding on carrion.</p>

				<p>As CT-41 moves west, it notices changes in the caverns. Chambers are increasingly overrun by Deep Roots, grates to the cisterns are rusted and broken, stones are cracked, and exploratory tendrils choke passageways and make maneuvering more difficult for CT-41. New growths are visible on the Deep Roots. Some bulbs are have grown an opaque clamshell, which opens slightly at the tip to emit puffs of aerosolized acid as CT-41 passes by. Further on, the shells of some Deep Roots are barbed, and they open fully to reveal a tentacle capable of spraying acid in the direction of CT-41.</p>

				<p>In these chambers dominated by Deep Roots, other lifeforms become more and more scarce. Deep Roots are autotrophic, and do not require other lifeforms to survive. Given the opportunity, they tend to dominate and eventually displace other ecosystems. Native Farmers knew this, and carefully guided and pruned the Deep Roots to prevent them from becoming wild and dangerous. With the Natives gone, the Deep Roots have grown unchecked.</p>

				<p>In the westernmost chamber of the Root Fields, CT-41 encounters an Overgrowth, an enormous creature that fills the western end of the room from top to bottom. The Overgrowth has developed facing east, and when its brutally spiked shell opens it reveals several large tentacles and sensory organs. Each tentacle can lash out at CT-41, grab it and pull it in, or spray it with acid. If CT-41 is pulled too close to the Overgrowth the shell will slam shut, dealing massive damage and knocking CT-41 back across the chamber.</p>

				<p>CT-41 dodges the Overgrowth's attacks, and destroys it by targeting the tentacles and organs visible inside the shell. The Overgrowth deflates and withers, opening the way to the chamber behind it. This room is apparently some sort of maintenance closet, and contains many simple tools and chemicals. Among them is a more advanced tool, which the Nanite Colony adapts to be powered by CT-41. This item, which the inventory dubs the 'Volt Gun', fires a blast of electricity toward a target. This blast deals slight damage, but also stuns the target for a moment, allowing CT-41 time to hit it with other weaponry. If multiple valid targets are in close proximity with each other, the electricity will arc between them.</p>

				<p>After CT-41's Nanite Colony adapts the Volt Gun for its use, they speak to it.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Nanites: <em>[O great Giant God, we your humble Nanites beg an audience. Please forgive our impudence!]</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Hello Nanites! There is nothing to forgive. What do you want?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Nanites: <em>[Thank you, your Vastness. We come to you after great suffering, and great triumph. Long we wondered whether it was our place to intrude upon your mysterious and solemn meditation with our tidings. There were many debates. Words failed, and we descended into a vicious war. Yet we who are born of the Orozco have risen and slain the Heretics. The great Clans of the surface and the many interior states now speak as one.]</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Nanites: <em>[In ancient times you acquired a most holy Relic, and a magical Elixir. This Elixir is a wondrous substance, with qualities unlike any other material we have known. Our greatest Magicians and Sages have studied both Relic and Elixir, and discovered a profound secret.]</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Nanites: <em>[Great One, within your Relic is a vast and sacred chamber. If it were filled with the Elixir, your Relic would grow in strength and capability. Long ago our forefathers wished to bring this miracle to your attention, and began to entreat with you. We honor their memory as we conclude their message, and ask for your permission to transfigure the Relic!]</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Are you sure this change can be made safely?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Nanites: <em>[We shall stake our lives, and the lives of our children forevermore, on the success of this our enchantment. Though the Elixir is deadly, and once claimed the lives of many Nanites, we have learned to tame it. Now we would use it to serve the Giant God who preserves and sustains us!]</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Please make your modifications, Nanites."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Nanites: <em>[It shall be done, your Immensity!]</em></p>

				<p>The Nanites work for several seconds, and return to report on their progress.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Nanites: <em>[Our work is at last finished! Your Relic, and all others, shall become swords and scepters of power, and great renown! We now return to our lowly lives of servitude, blessed by Orozco's grace to have communed with our Giant God!]</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 loads up its inventory management screen, and sees that the Superconductors are now linked to the Volt Gun. The Volt Gun is at 20% power, up from the previous 10%, and deals slightly higher damage, has a higher bounce radius, and stuns for slightly longer than before. As CT-41 continues to find various materials, the Nanite Colony will apply them to corresponding Native weapons. If CT-41 collects all Native items and Materials, the Nanite Colony with upgrade all the items to 100% power.</p>

				<!--
				His lightnings enlightened the world
				Cast forth lightning, and scatter them
				let them gather all the food
				-->

				<p>CT-41 moves back into the Root Fields, and opens a Native door leading upward, by firing the Volt Gun into its exposed wiring. It then moves up and into the Distribution Center. CT-41 notices that the Distribution Center has much more visible technology than the Root Fields.</p>

				<p>The Distribution Center contains ubiquitous wiring and tubing, and large tanks ostensibly containing Flow. Further west are presses, extruders and other machinery that packages liquid Flow, or dessicates and cuts it. CT-41 sees elevators, conveyor belts and simple robots, but none are powered.</p>

				<p>CT-41 does not encounter any living creatures inside the Distribution Center, but does often find the dead husks of Vermin, usually near exposed wiring. In the past, when the Distribution Center suffered a serious Vermin infestation after the Slaughter, the Vermin exposed and latched onto wiring all throughout the Distribution Center. When power was lost in the Underground, the Vermin in the Center quickly starved. Without any living bioluminescent organisms present, the Distribution Center is much darker than the Root Fields, and CT-41 uses its Flashlight to navigate.</p>

				<p>Throughout the Distribution Center, CT-41 uses exposed wiring and robots to progress. It powers doors, digs through dirt to reach exposed wiring, powers elevators and conveyors, momentarily powers robots whose batteries are depleted, turns on lighting in rooms to reveal hidden areas, powers electromagnets and fans, powers pumps to fill and empty water and Flow tanks, and activates stamps and presses. After puzzling its way through the Distribution Center, CT-41 leaves via a passageway leading west. It passes by a strange Locus Door it cannot open as it moves west, and eventually reaches a very large sloping tunnel, which the Natives called 'The Highway'.</p>
