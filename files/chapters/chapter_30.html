				<p>CT-41 decides that it should accumulate all the Items, Materials, and Companions that it can before facing Voronash. It looks to its Map, and all the patches of darkness at its fringes, and decides to discover their secrets. At the base of the Farmlands, near the Underworld, is a region CT-41 has not yet explored. It uses the Altar network to move to the Fly Traps, and moves down toward the collapsed Native statue that once blocked its downward progress. When it reaches the statue, CT-41 equips the Impact Cannon, and blasts the statue apart. It then moves down into the Enclave, a secluded deeper region of the Farmlands. This incredibly warm region would have dealt damage over time to CT-41 if it arrived without the Thermal Shielding.</p>

				<p>The Enclave is different from the rest of the Farmlands. The habitations are elegant carved stone chambers, organically shaped and faithful to the contours of the caverns. Though they chose a natural aesthetic for their homeland, the Faithful who lived here were not primitive. Evidence of sophisticated steam and heat powered machinery is present in the Lower Root Fields and Flow Caverns. Lighting is provided by Deep Root bulbs that have been shaped and encouraged to grow in convenient and visually pleasing paths.</p>

				<p>CT-41 explores east into the Flow Caverns, a highly sterilized environment where the Faithful stored their produce in enormous pools. The Faithful kept the chambers immaculately clean and isolated, and no hint of non-Native life is present within. CT-41 works its way through, across and over sticky, bubbling Flow pools, and through machinery that slowly agitates the fluid and regulates its temperature. As in other areas inhabited by the Faithful, machinery is powered by heat directly from the Magma Chamber below, rather than by electricity from the Lumene grid. At the far eastern end of the Flow Caverns CT-41 finds the Medusa next to the petrified body of one of the Faithful.</p>

				<p>CT-41 leaves the Flow Caverns, and moves down into ruins that seem to emerge from the form of the caverns themselves. Statues and likenesses are made from stalactites and stalagmites, and CT-41 observes a winding, knotted aesthetic carved into the stone, as if in imitation of Deep Root growth. Pulsing lights from Deep Root bulbs intermingle and cast eerie shadows. The caverns grow continually warmer as CT-41 moves deeper into the crust of Lumen 2 east of the Magma Chambers. The roots grow wider, and large, boiling, liquid filled nodes begin to appear on the Deep Roots. Many large and formidable creatures have made their abode in these timeless halls, and attack CT-41 as it intrudes.</p>

				<p>Finally CT-41 reaches a cavern dominated by an huge mass of layered nodes, so large that only a portion of the organism is visible. Thick roots lead up and away from the nodes, which are innumerable, and of many different sizes. Fluid, steam and light move through them, and the nodes pulsate in many different rythms. Activity increases as if in response to CT-41's movements. CT-41 can attack the mass, but it is impervious to CT-41's weaponry. Its only response is to increase the speed of its pulsations, and change the color and frequency of its lights.</p>

				<p>Certain areas of the chamber have been expanded to allow nodes to grow in new pockets, and roots to extend in new directions. An intricately sculpted incline leads to a platform in front of the enormous organism. Atop the platform are the remains of a solitary Lumene Native, facing the mass of bulbous nodes as if in supplication. A delicate flask is in front of it. CT-41 moves up the incline, and the Companion intrudes upon its mind.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"There is a viable Seed left within this Farmer's corpse. If you desire, form your thoughts, and I will carry them to it. Perhaps the Farmer will allow me to empower his Seed, and join us in our journey."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 moves next to the Native, and begins to communicate.</p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Hello, Farmer."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Farmer: <em>"I suppose I must be talking to myself, but I'm not sure what I am."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"You are not talking to yourself. I am talking to you, who are a Farmer of the Kindred."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Farmer: <em>"I'm not talking to myself? ...That's just what I would say. And although I was a Farmer, I distinctly remember becoming nothing. I certainly don't feel like my old self. In fact, I don't feel anything at all."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"And if I'm not talking to myself, then who are you? Don't tell me you're the 'Transcendence' that the Rulers and Engineers are always babbling about..."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"No. I am an artificial lifeform, a Caretaker automaton. I came to your world with my creators to study your civilization."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Farmer: <em>"An artificial lifeform? Did nature not produce you? What makes you so confident in your artificiality?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I was designed by rational beings, rather than produced by unthinking selective processes."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Farmer: <em>"Hmm. I've felt an artificial being in my mind, or at least something distinctly unnatural... You are not such a being."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"No, I am not. You spoke earlier of a Transcendence. What is it?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Farmer: <em>"The Philosophers are convinced that our Seeds house a higher mind, a sort of passenger that lives in a realm of abstraction. They think they can tap into this mind, experience a reality outside of the here and now... A lot of good it did them!"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Who are the Philosophers?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Farmer: <em>"Rulers and Engineers... Here I am, speaking with a machine, and answering the questions put to me by its disembodied voice. This is not the afterlife I had envisioned..."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I am sorry if I am upsetting you."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Farmer: <em>"You're not upsetting me, Caretaker. I've lived through plenty of upsetting times, and this is not one of them. You must concede, however, that the situation we find ourselves in is a peculiar one. How exactly are we talking to each other?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Your Seed can continue to function even after your body's death. It produces thought and sensation when properly stimulated, as it did in life. One of your Kinsman is acting as my translator, allowing us to communicate."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Farmer: <em>"Not sure how that all works, or if I even believe you. Let's pretend I do. WHY are we talking to each other?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I found your Seed among your remains, and decided to speak with you."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Farmer: <em>"Can't argue with that. Is there anything you want from me?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I want whatever information you can give me, and I would have you join me in my mission, if you are willing."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Farmer: <em>"That depends on the information, and the mission. What would you like to know?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Who were you in life?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Farmer: <em>"You got it right earlier, I was a Farmer. Am a Farmer? Who can say? Anyways, I was one of the Faithful. We never went to the surface with the Fools. For more than 500 Cycles I tended the deep roots in the lower fields, and came here to interpret the lights of the Origin."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"The Fools went to the surface, and were burned for it. Apparently after they colonized Three and Four, they sent some probes out into the emptiness. Something out there saw the probes, and sent fire spewing vessels to destroy them. Almost all the Fools would have been killed, except for the Warriors' intervention... For once their instinct to violence proved useful."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"As you may know, there was a time when Warriors killed Farmers, stole our food, and drove us from our land. I remember the long war to win our home back. Those memories are far back on the chain, but I can't say that I've ever regarded the Warriors with fondness. In this instance, however, I must acknowledge their bravery. I never could've piloted crafts through the emptiness as they did, even to save my own life. And they did it to save the lives of others."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"... ..."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"...What happened next?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Farmer: <em>"Where was I? Right... Down here we didn't feel more than a tremor during the destruction. Might as well have been just another cavern collapsing up in no man's land. Afterwards life continued as normal. I tended the roots, and read the lights of the Origin."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"A few Lives later something did get to us, though. So some damned uppity Explorer built a network of transport stations all over the underground. How do they work? No one knows, but the Engineers say they might be popping matter right out of the universe and pulling it back in elsewhere. All is going well, the Fools are happy with their Altars, when out of nowhere the Laborers go crazy. Boil the Rulers alive in their locus, and start preaching the doctrine of 'Purification'. Fortunately there aren't any Laborers here. We Faithful aren't afraid of work."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Soon after we felt a presence in our minds. It wasn't like yours at all; it felt like a perversion of one of the older minds, something that spoke to the Simpleton. It rooted out some of the memories we keep hidden on the Chain. We knew what the Presence had done to the Laborers, how it had driven them to murder the Rulers, and we told ourselves we wouldn't let it happen to us. We were wrong."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"... ..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I'm not gonna tell you about what it was like, being manipulated by a mind so much larger than my own. Just thinking about it makes it feel like he's here, in my Seed, all over again. And I pity the Fools: I don't think we felt the Presence as strongly as they did. The Tyrant let us stay here, in our Enclave. Many of the Fools had to relocate closer to the Holy City. I think the Tyrant was wary of their technologies."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"He didn't keep us bound forever, mind you. There came a moment when the Tyrant's grip weakened, and during that time one of the Healers thought up a truth the Tyrant couldn't allow. He couldn't even fathom it. And when a messenger came, bearing the Deliverer's truth, the Tyrant could no longer Synchronize with us. He had no power over us at all."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What was the truth that freed you?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Farmer: <em>"It's difficult to share with you, Caretaker, even if I were inclined to do so. Suffice it to say, it is a truth which no Tyrant can possess, and remain himself."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What did you do with your freedom?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Farmer: <em>"Same thing we did when the Warriors took what was ours. We fought back! For the first time in an Age I left the Enclave, with many other Faithful. We marched to the Assembly Hall, gathering what weapons we could find, and killing any Servants that got in our way. For the first time in an Age we met with Healers, Engineers, other Farmers, and even a few aging Explorers. With the Rulers gone, Engineers and Explorers took charge."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"We decided we had to act fast. There was no telling what devilry the Tyrant was cooking up in his Temple. We stormed through his Holy City and scattered the Servants. Sadly we had to kill many Kinsman from the Correction Chambers, the ones too broken to receive the Secret Thought. We finally reached the lower door to the Throneroom, but never saw the Tyrant himself."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"We didn't break down his door, but it opened anyway, and three... things came out. I don't know what they were, but I'm certain that they were not of this world. The Faithful in the vanguard were killed almost instantly, and we would have fled in a rout if our Deliverer hadn't struck back at one of the phantoms. It recoiled, and we felt its fear. Just lengths from the Throneroom we fought the Tyrant's greatest servants, and we would have destroyed them..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"But victory was just beyond our sight and reach. The Tyrant began calling to all the low creatures of the Underground, those too stupid to learn our Secret Thought. The masses of the ignorant began to crowd in around our flank, and the unholy weight of their number would have overwhelmed us. We fought our way back to the Assembly Hall, and barricaded the passage to the west behind us."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Sure, most of us were still alive, but what had we accomplished? Nothing!"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"... ..."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Are you there?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Farmer: <em>"Yeah, I'm fine. It's just, this is not where I want to live right now."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Farmer: <em>"But we'll finish what we started... In the Assembly Hall the Healers tended to the wounded, while several Engineers found and prepared an Executor to fight with us during our next attack. We still had hope. Yet while we strategized and recovered our strength, our enemy was hard at work. Far too late, our old and feeble Explorers came to us with news of movement to the east. Before we had time to think, much less act, the Tyrant brought an army of creatures against us, strange brutes from distant caverns in the Wild. At the front of this army were Beasts, the same Beasts that the Warriors and Executors had held off for Ages."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"We still might have defeated this new force, but as we turned against it, the Phantoms and slaves from the Holy City began to dismantle the barricade that held them back. When they finally broke through, we were surrounded. Our Executor was destroyed, and our position was overrun. My Kinsmen and I escaped down whatever tunnels we could, and the Phantoms and Beasts turned over every stone of the Underground looking for us..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"When I knew there was nowhere left to run or hide, I came here to drink bitter Flow in front of the Origin. It felt like the thing to do, and I didn't question it... still don't. I wasn't alone among the Faithful in my decision. The slaves of the Tyrant only found bodies when they came to our Enclave, and that's where the story of my life ends."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Who are the Faithful?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Farmer: <em>"We're Farmers, but the Warriors never came down to OUR fields to raid. We helped our fellow Farmers in their war, but we owe no debt of gratitude to any Lineage. We don't consult the Rulers or the Engineers before making decisions, we tend to our own, and we leave others in peace. The Farmers from above bring us news, but we don't regularly receive other guests. The Deep Roots of the Origin have sustained us for thousands of Lives, and will conti..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"...We never felt the need to change what worked, to reach for more than what we needed, or to break things in order to make short cuts. Damn the Fools."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Pardon me for not asking earlier, but what is your name?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Farmer: <em>"Not a problem, Caretaker, though I suspect you would have difficulty understanding my name. Among the Faithful my title is 'Seer'."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"You spoke of an Origin. What is it?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Seer: <em>"The Faithful discovered the Origin after the war, as we carefully traced the Deep Roots to their source. For many Lives my parents studied the patterns of the lights and pulses. We counted the Cycles, and learned the slow speech of the Origin. We stored a great surplus of Flow, in preparation for famines which come when the Origin rests, and yields are poor."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"All true roots stem from the Origin in front of you. Its tendrils reach all through the Deeps, looking for good chambers to blossom. It's got a mind of its own, and those who know how to read it can learn a great deal. It knows when the magma chambers will be warm, and where its roots and bulbs are in danger. Its roots carry water, heat and light through our halls, as long we treat them properly. And I am glad, even as my people and I are dead, that the Origin lives forever."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"... ..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Caretaker, much of what I have just told you is sacred knowledge of my people. We do not share it, even with the Farmers above us... though I suppose there's no harm in telling you now."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I thank you for your information. Now to my second request: I oppose the Tyrant, and all beings like him. The companion who has facilitated our communication is more than a translator. He can empower your Seed, to rise from your body, and see through my eyes. I would be honored if you joined me, to give me whatever aid you can in my exploration and battles."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Seer: <em>"I'm not sure what exactly I can offer you, but I'd be glad to help drive off those who steal and destroy, just like in the War. Do what you need to get me up and moving!"</em></p>

				<p>The Necrolith glows brightly, and the Seer's Seed rises from its remains.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Seer: <em>"It's nice to see again, even if your vision isn't quite as good as mine was! My sincerest thanks, Caretaker."</em></p>

				<p>A few seconds pass as the Seer takes in its surroundings.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Seer: <em>"I just noticed my body lying there. Not exactly a vision of grace. Please look somewhere else. Also, I think you're making the Origin nervous. It must recognize you from somewhere... Let's get moving."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 moves out of the chamber of the Origin, with the green Seed of the Seer now following it. The Companion gains the ability to #POWER, linking with the Seer to #ACTION.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">A Fountain Of Life</div>

				<p>CT-41 moves back up to the Lower Root Fields, whose slope matches that of the Magma Chamber beneath. Here Deep Roots grow in their natural environment, and many Lumene lifeforms of the Deep Root biosphere have been allowed to flourish. Metal bands are attached directly to Deep Roots, either to harvest Flow or to power equipment. Some Deep Roots are bandaged where equipment had previously been attached. Several Overgrowths have formed in these fields. Scattered throughout this area are simple but elegant fishing systems. Artificial ponds and pools teem with simple aquatic life, once bred and eaten by the Faithful. As in all the Lower Root Fields, there are many Deep Root growths in the shape of Lumene Natives, and intermingled with Native remains.</p>

				<p>CT-41 treks across the gently rolling cavern floor, destroying or evading the Overgrowths and other creatures that lie before it. At the western end of the Lower Root Fields CT-41 sees a strange door, unlike any other in the Realm. It is a great stone effigy, in the likeness of a ravening primal Native. Curling around its limbs are Deep Root vines, and Deep Root bulbs illuminate its savage features. CT-41 approaches the sphinx-like colossus. The color of the bulbs change as the Seer draws near, and the brute's great maw opens. The Seer speaks to CT-41.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Seer: <em>"'This is wisdom: To look upon the Mystery with reverence, and defiance. To let it live, and to let it sleep. To laud its strength, and despise its weakness.'"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Caretaker, this corridor leads to the caves of the Ritual. I entered, more than once, but I never did reach the end of the Path, or discover the Mystery. If I had, I could have joined the Elders, and passed my position and knowledge on to my children..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"You know, I think I could have done it. I think part of me wanted to fail, so that my children could learn the Mystery themselves... Not that any of that matters now."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 moves cautiously into the opening, and notices several changes. The stone walls of the tunnels and chambers are carved to look like the interior of a Lumene Native. CT-41 moves through an artistic representation of a Native's internals, and finds passageways leading to various limbs and organs. The entire complex is a tomb, devoid of life, but filled with strange writings and images. CT-41 must use many of its physical tools to navigate toward the Seed.</p>

				<p>Once it reaches the Seed, the tests become more difficult. Symbols of the Chain of Memory flow all throughout the caverns here. CT-41 must solve intricate glowstone puzzles to unlock doors, and pass through to inner chambers representing portions of the Native mind. Statues and reliefs representing arcane events in the shared Native Chain of Memory adorn the halls. The Seed is full of complicated steam powered machinery. Gears turn and valves release jets of high pressure vapor as CT-41 interfaces with the logical puzzles left by the Faithful. When CT-41 solves the last puzzle and attempts to enter the final door of the Ritual, the Outsider speaks to it.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"I sense an ancient mind, Caretaker. I do not worship the Old Gods, but I will not contend with them either."</em></p>

				<p>The Outsider, and all other currently active Companions retreat into CT-41's front access panel. CT-41 passes through the door, and enters a tunnel whose walls are unadorned, and where no techonology is present. The tunnel leads to a high vaulted chamber with the aspect of a natural cathedral. Huge, bulbous stalactites cling to the roof, and docile Deep Root growths spring up next to shallow steaming pools of water that dot the floor.</p>

				<p>At the center of the chamber, which is the center of the giant Native's Seed, is the Old God Ashtoreth. Its dormant bulk is covered in a thick, resinous shell, which is further encased in twining Deep Root shoots. In ages past select members of the Faithful navigated through the caverns of the Ritual and discovered Ashtoreth. CT-41 finds itself in the same situation, but decides to provoke the hulking monster with a laser. The Old God stirs, and its resinous shell begins to crack. As soon as it awakens, the door to the chamber locks behind CT-41.</p>

				<p>Like all Old Gods, Ashtoreth is an enomrous, powerful and heavily armored creature, an ancient and distant relative of the Beast. It is slow moving and groggy when it first emerges from dormancy, but as it is provoked by CT-41 it becomes increasingly alert and swift. It lumbers, and later races toward CT-41, trampling the Deep Roots. Ashtoreth later smashes the ground, stunning CT-41 briefly if it is grounded, and knocking stalactites from the ceiling. Ashtoreth is able to leap great distances, dealing massive damage on impact if it hits CT-41. Unlike the other Old Gods CT-41 later encounters, Ashtoreth occasionally spawns young, which scramble toward CT-41. A pulsing light shines between the cracks of its thick armor plates, and causes its skin to glow from within.</p>

				<p>During a long and fierce battle, Ashteroth's internal light pulses with increasing frequency, and it becomes increasingly desparate and brutal. CT-41 blasts apart its armor plating, exposing the vulnerable flesh beneath. In the end CT-41 defeats the Old God, who lets out a last echoing bellow, and falls to the ground. CT-41 moves toward the lifeless and quickly putrefying mass, and grabs Ashtoreth's glowing Seed. After a few minutes pass, the Nanite Colony speaks to CT-41.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Nanites: <em>"O great Giant God, legend tells that the universe trembled during the tumult of your battle. The great Daemon, formed in the dark Beyond before the Beginning, dared to contend with our God. Yet you cast down your foe, and laid claim to his dying mind."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Our ancestors studied the curious orb you took. Guided by Orozco's Light, they discerned that it might be transfigured to serve you. We have labored long to realize the transformation, and now present to you this divine Relic. May it serve your Enormity forever!"</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 opens its inventory screen, and sees that the God's Heart is available to it. CT-41 equips this enormously powerful generator, and a pulsing white light can be seen filtering through the joints between its armor plates. The rate of the pulsing increases the lower CT-41's battery gets. CT-41 has now found every generator available to it in Truth II.</p>
