				<p>CT-41 falls for several seconds into increasing darkness, until its running lights are the only source of light, and it can only see the area immediately around it. It splashes into a deep, clean pool, and equips its flashlight. At both sides of the pool are steps leading onto flat ground. CT-41 moves east, and reaches the back side of the Penitent's Door. When it moves west, it finds a series of steps leading up, and forming a truncated pyramid. The whole host of Lumene organisms is represented in bas relief on the side of this pyramid, with the Native Lineages forming a line at the top.</p>

				<p>As CT-41 ascends the pyramid, a light begins to shine from its peak. CT-41 cannot see the source, and continues moving up toward it. Eventually CT-41 sees the flat top of the pyramid, and beholds the incarnation of Thosmodeme.</p>

				<p>Like other Singularities, Thosmodeme is not a product of this universe. His shape is abstract and ever-changing, at times flowing and ethereal, and at others times harsh and angular. He does not attempt to communicate with CT-41, an Abomination, and CT-41 receives no response if it attempts to communicate with the Tyrant.</p>

				<p>Soon after CT-41 makes contact with Thosmodeme, the Lord of Lumen begins to radiate with intense energy, occasionally striking out at CT-41 with lancing beams of strange energy. Unlike his Fragments, Thosmodeme never abandons his physical form during his fight with CT-41, though when he does take damage his form wavers.</p>

				<p>Thosmodeme is a being of adamant, a lover of order, stone, and metal. After he takes damage from CT-41, he will often enter an invulnerable diamantine state, in which he lifts and hurls the very stones of his Throne Room toward CT-41. These deal massive damage to CT-41 when they hit.</p>

				<p>As the fight progresses, and CT-41 deals significant damage to Thosmodeme, a resounding crash echoes through the Deep. Thosmodeme's aspect changes, he returns to the top of his pyramid, and he begins to shine with incredible light. Once he can no longer contain his stored energies, the Tyrant releases a massive radial blast, that knocks CT-41 backward, and disables it. Thosmodeme then turns toward the western wall of his Throne Room.</p>

				<p>As the Nanite Colony works desperately to repair CT-41, the earth begins to shake and rumble. There are three loud crashes that shake the Throne Room from side to side, before the stone of the western wall is broken down, and a new being enters the battle chamber.</p>

				<p>From its position of vulnerability, CT-41 witnesses a battle of lights that moves toward it. The great Thosmodeme, weakened during its battle with CT-41, is driven east by a hazy, filthy being of darkness, which takes on various monstrous shapes as it lashes out with horrid and vindictive strength at the Tyrant. Its blows begin to crack, and then shatter, the diamantine form of Thosmodeme, pulling broken pieces of the Tyrant into itself.</p>

				<p>When Thosmodeme is damaged beyond his ability to continue fighting, this newcomer, Voronash, envelops him completely with his repellant, oozing darkness. The foul cocoon pulses with light as Thosmodeme attempts to build up energy to blast through and escape, but the Tyrant's strength finally fails. The Devouring Spirit begins to contract, and a grinding sound of crushing glass fills the chamber as Thosmodeme shatters and his light is extinguished.</p>

				<p>Voronash absorbs Thosmodeme, growing in size while crystalline protrusions, shards of the crushed Thosmodeme, begin to extend out of its black, oily visage. These spikes never peirce through Voronash's amorphous skin, and are as dark as ever. The Nanite Colony finishes repairing CT-41, and it regains its movement and combat abilities.</p>

				<small>"Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations. All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us?"</small>
