				<p>CT-41 immediately appears atop the Prime Altar, but the surrounding chamber is changed. The metal of the room gleams brightly as if new, and the equipment is well maintained. There is no hint of decay or of the Angels' iconography. CT-41 is free to explore the chamber, but the security doors leading out of the room are shut and locked. CT-41 finds the waste tank filled almost to brimming with young Native remains. If CT-41 attempts to compress time, the Outsider will intrude upon it.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"I cannot contain the Devouring Spirit much longer, Caretaker. We must fulfill our purpose here, and quickly. Take me to the foolish young Explorer who lives here, that I might speak with him. Our conversation will be ours alone. His name is Necromancer."</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves to the Terminal that controls the Prime Altar, and finds the Necromancer standing near it, in shock. CT-41 moves forward to speak with the bewildered Explorer. If it attempts to use its weaponry, the Necrolith will shine brightly as the Outsider intervenes. The Outsider speaks to CT-41 to explain his action.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"Though I am now in possession of great power, Caretaker, I assure you I do not wield it lightly. I stayed your weapon because I cannot allow you to damage any equipment here. One errant blast could undo all that we have worked to accomplish."</p>

				<p>CT-41 introduces itself to the  Necromancer.</p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Hello, Necromancer. I am CT-41, a Caretaker Automaton."</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Necromancer: <em>"How do... Why do you call me 'Necromancer'? How did you come here?"</p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I know much of what was, and is, and will be, Necromancer. My Companion wishes to speak to you, and may answer your questions."</p>

				<p>The Necrolith moves toward the Necromancer, and begins to pulse rapidly as the ancient Outsider speaks to his younger self. The young Outsider begins to curl up and retreat in upon himself, and the lights of his protests grow few and faint as the Outsider chastises him. Finally the Outsider releases the Necromancer from the grip of his voice, and again speaks to CT-41.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"All has been arranged. The Necromancer will destroy this cursed Altar after I am gone. If he does not, kill him. Farewell, Caretaker."</p>

				<p>The Necrolith separates from CT-41 and moves to the Prime Altar. Voronash begins to struggle mightily against the Necrolith, and cracks can be seen forming in its surface. The Altar powers up, the vacuum seal forms, and the Necrolith disappears, cast into the Outside.</p>

				<p>Power continues to build within the Altar after the Outsider vanishes, until the Altar experiences a catastrophic failure and is destroyed by a massive electrostatic discharge. An electromagnetic pulse blasts out from the Altar, and CT-41's vision flickers several time before going permanently dark.</p>

				<small>"Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee."</small>
