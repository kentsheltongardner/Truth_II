				Golden Executor is invincible.
				Golden Executor is larger than other Executors.
				Golden Executor houses a living Native, rather than a Seed.
				Golden Executor can be used to easily destroy an Iron Executor guarding the Restricted Area.
				CT-41 enters the Golden Executor through a hatch on the top.
				Golden Executor can push Seals.
				Golden Executor can destroy Security Doors.
				CT-41 can use the weight of the Golden Executor to break floors, destroy certain objects.
				CT-41 can use the Golden Executor to move through the Restricted Area, but cannot move through the narrow passagway leading to the Enforcer.

				Destroyers create devices called Surge Protectors that drain all energy spikes from unknown sources.
				Surge Protectors are orbs that grow brightly whenever CT-41 tries to use a tool.
				Destroyer constructs are able to use electronic tools in Destroyer areas.
				If the Golden Executor's tools or CT-41's tools are in the line-of-sight of a Surge Protector, they will not function.
				Surge Protectors can be destroyed.
				Some Surge Protectors are mobile.
				CT-41 may attempt to enter the Restricted Area without the Executor, but will quickly find itself unable to progress, once it enters an area completely covered by Surge Protectors.
				CT-41 can move past the Surge Protectors by attacking them from cover, or using the Executor to destroy them physically.
				CT-41 can use the Executor as cover to attack the Surge Protectors.
				CT-41 can position objects or enemies such that Surge Protectors cannot prevent it or the Executor from attacking.

				Surge Protectors are found in the Restricted Area and the Destroyer Wreck, but are more prominent in and constitute the primary puzzle element of the Restricted Area.

				<p>CT-41 returns to the Highway, and rolls east through the wide passage until it reaches the Hearth. The three corridors leading to the Hearth's Forbidden Chambers are closed off by massive stone Seals placed by Laborers under Thosmodeme's influence during the Dark Age. On the front of these Seals are carves the frightening visages of the three separate Draconid strains. Although CT-41 cannot destroy or tunnel past these Seals, it is able to enter the Domiciles via piping from the Sea.</p>

				<p>The Domiciles are efficiently designed living compartments, with a sleek and spartan aesthetic. Habitations and passageways are lined with uniform, no-frills paneling, and electrical, ventilation and plumbing systems are well hidden. As CT-41 scours the Domiciles, it finds several carefully stowed Materials, as well as creatures that have wormed their way into the Forbidden Chambers and now call them home. If the Stargazer has joined CT-41 as a Companion, CT-41 can open the Engineers' Locus Doors, and enter the Prototyping Labs.</p>

				<p>The Prototyping Labs pulse with the lifeblood of the vanished Engineers. Gas lines, wiring, and water tubing are left uncovered. Many rooms have Terminals, and throughout the Labs CT-41 uses the Native Prosthetics to control vehicles, machinery, and experimental devices. In the larger, multi-storied Labs CT-41 finds Navigators still sitting in their ancient charging stations, and can use them to access areas it could not otherwise reach.</p>

				<p>As in the Domiciles, certain Prototyping Labs have been infiltrated by lower Lumene lifeforms, and CT-41 must work its way through overgrown and unpowered sections of the Forbidden Chambers as it charts the region. Some Labs are flooded or unpowered, and in others the water is electrified. There are several Molecular Assemblers in the Prototyping Labs, which CT-41 must use to create needed objects.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">I Will Direct All His Ways</div>

				<p>CT-41 finds a large and sturdy door that leads to the Restricted Area. A scanner above the door passes over CT-41, but does not allow it to enter. Instead CT-41 moves forward to a Prototyping Lab that houses a hulking Golden Executor surounded by a large scaffolding framework. CT-41 prepares for a fight, but the Executor does not move in response to CT-41's arrival. It sits, powered down inside its scaffolding, and allows CT-41 to walk past. CT-41 notes that the Lab appears to be a manufacture and testing chamber rather than a deployment area.</p>

				<p>CT-41 climbs up the scaffolding, and discovers that it can enter the giant Executor via a hatch at its top. CT-41 falls down into a cramped space, and interfaces with a Terminal inside using the Native Prosthetics. The Executor powers up, and begins to move in response to CT-41's commands.</p>

				<p>The huge Executor is slower than CT-41, and the ground beneath it shakes after a fall or a jump. The Executor is equipped with two powerful weapons, an Antimatter Howitzer and a Battering Ram. The Battering Ram smashes into enemies and sends them flying, while the Antimatter Howitzer launches munitions that deal immense damage to targets and produce large shockwaves. Both tools are obviously oversized for CT-41 and incompatible with its architecture.</p>

				<p>CT-41 begins to move the Executor through the Forbidden Chambers, although some doorways are too small for it to enter. Leveraging the Executor's great size and strength, CT-41 is able to push the Seals that prevent access to the Forbidden Chambers out of position. From this point onward, CT-41 can access the Forbidden Chambers easily from the Farmland, the Geothermal Power Station, and the Highway.</p>

				<p>Eventually CT-41 returns to the Security Door leading to the Restricted Area, which opens for the Executor. Before fully entering the Restricted Area, the Executor is held in a clean room for a few seconds as radiation washes over it. Once two passes are complete, another large door at the far end of the chamber opens. CT-41 leaves the clean room and enters the immaculately preserved Restricted Area. CT-41 sees that there are no Lumene organisms within the Restricted Area, but does notice a small, hovering object with an abrupt movement pattern that quickly moves out of sight.</p>

				<p>The Restricted Area is filled with Destroyer material specimens collected from the surface of Lumen 2 and the Destroyer Wreck. The dark fragments of machinery are boxed, or set on examining tables. Certain rooms within the Restricted Area were clearly dedicated to the duplication of Destroyer technologies. CT-41 encounters simple remotely tethered objects, ostensibly created by Native Engineers.</p>

				<p>Under CT-41's control the Executor moves further into the Restricted Area, and begins to encounter strange, organically mechanical creatures. The majority of these constructs are busy removing Native equipment and structural elements, and replacing them with Destroyer technology. The Executor blasts its way through observers, pests, challenges and threats as it moves deeper into the Restricted Area.</p>

				<p>The principal obstacles to CT-41's movement through the Restricted Area are Surge Protectors. These strange Destroyer orbs hang from the ceilings and protrude from the floors, and are occasionally carried by mobile Destroyer constructs. Whenever CT-41 or the Golden Executor attempt to use projectile or beam emitting tools within a Surge Protector's unobstructed sphere of influence, the energy build-up is absorbed, and the Surge Protector grows more brightly.</p>

				<p>In order to use the tools necessary to navigate, CT-41 must destroy or outwit several Surge Protectors. It can position the Executor to protect it, smash the Surge Protectors with the Executor's Battering Ram, stay outside the Surge Protector's line of sight, and use objects or constructs to block Surge Protectors. CT-41 can use the Corner Cutter to attack Surge Protectors from advantageous positions. Additionally, CT-41 can use the Executor as a stepping stool to reach difficult to access areas.</p>

				<p>Eventually the Executor reaches the Containment Unit, where the Linguist once studied the Custodian. During the period where power was lost throughout the Realm, the Containment Unit failed, and the Custodian escaped. Though the Containment Unit is now functional after CT-41 restored power, the Custodian is nowhere to be found.</p>

				<p>CT-41 continues through the Restricted Area, occasionally spotting the flighty Custodian as it moves into a region, newly bored into the crust, whose construction consists entirely of Destroyer materials. Unbeknownst to CT-41, all the Destroyer constructs it has encountered have been created by the Custodian, which is trying to 'repair' and maintain what it thinks is the very damaged inside of a Gateway. Through the misapplication of its programming, the furthest reaches of the Restricted Area have been completely transformed into a Destroyer space.</p>

				<p>When it reaches the bottom of the overrun area, CT-41 leaves the Restricted Area, and moves into a region of Destroyer infrastructure built in natural caverns. After moving through several chambers in this area, CT-41 sees the Custodian again. With its small but operational Gateway, the fully repaired Custodian begins to bring in large groups of subordinate Destroyer constructs to attack the Executor.</p>

				<p>CT-41 uses the Executor to blast its way through the swarm of small attackers as it chase the Custodian. The flighty Destroyer construct flees, moving through a tunnel which the Executor is too large to enter. CT-41 leaves the Executor, and moves into the Custodian's domain.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">My Yoke Is Easy, And My Burden Is Light</div>

				<p>At the heart of this Destroyer outbreak CT-41 battles past stationary defenses and mobile combat units. Eventually it finds a chamber filled with broadcast equipment. The Custodian stops running, and enters the core of a large protective construct. This exoskeleton is an Enforcer, a construct designed to allow the Custodian to suppress pests and threats. The doors to the chamber close, and the Custodian housed within the Enforcer attacks.</p>

				<p>The Enforcer uses a variety of weapons as it battles CT-41, all of them brought to Lumen 2 via the Custodian's tool port. Among them is a Volatility Launcher, a tool capable of hurling a Volatility in a ballistic arc, and detonating it at any time. The Custodian quickly repairs the Enforcer after a short time if it doesn't take damage, and CT-41 must aggressively pursue the Enforcer, while dodging its many and varied weapons, if it hopes to defeat the construct.</p>

				<p>After destroying the Enforcer and the Custodian inside it, all Destroyer constructs in the Restricted Area power down. CT-41 leaves the command and control chamber, and eventually finds a Native elevator leading up to the new areas of the Restricted Area. CT-41 continues up back up into the Prototyping Labs, where it continues its explorations without the Executor.</p>

				<p>Eventually CT-41 finds another Seal, this one leading toward the Farmlands. Without the Using the Executor's great strength, cannot push the Seal out of the way and leave the Forbidden Chambers. CT-41 struggles to find an exit, and as it does so finds a Native Tool called a Mass Inhibitor. Once the Nanite Colony adapts the tool for its use, CT-41 returns to the Seal, and while firing the Mass Inhibitor at the huge stone, finds itself able to move it out of the way, and leaves the Hearth.</p>

				<!--

					CT-41 finds a section of the Destroyer wreck that is almost identical to the converted portion of the Restricted Area

					Purpose is the primary driver of interest
					Making purpose apparent is necessary to this goal

					Is the Custodian's purpose adequate? (repairing/maintaining its 'Gateway')
					Can this purpose be made apparent?

					Mini-boss?
					finds the strange attractor/strange repulsor? Should these items exist?
					enter the Executor's prototyping lab
					Finds a control room and a Terminal
					With the Executor is able to pass through the Quarantine Doors
					Finds a repository that has been overwhel

					Secret involving keeping the Executor alive until CT-41 finds a future item
