			He Built Altars For All - And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord.
			
			Altars To That Shameful Thing - For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal.
			
			Upon The Horns Of Your Altars - The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond: it is graven upon the table of their heart, and upon the horns of your altars;

			Your Altars Shall Be Desolate - And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.

			Bones Round About Your Altars - And I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.

			Many Altars To Sin - Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.

			the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.

				<p>Now that CT-41 has restored power to the Underground, it is able to operate Native generic Native doors, in addition to many other devices. CT-41 can move much more freely through the Native Loci, and can find its way more easily through halls that were once dark. Most importantly, CT-41 is able to traverse vast distances instantly using the now powered Altars.</p>

				<p>Shortly after destroying the Vermin Supreme and leaving the turbine room, CT-41 finds a secret chamber, hidden to the west of the Geothermal Power Station. In this room is an unpowered Altar, whose buried wiring is visibly disconnected from the Lumene grid. CT-41 pushes a conductive box into the hole where it sees the exposed wiring, and moves atop the Altar. Two light sources at the edge of the Altar project a holographic map into the air, showing brightly colored nodes connected by straight lines. Inactive or obstructed Altars are represented by a different color, and are not interconnected with the rest. CT-41 is able to choose to move to one of the Altars represented by the nodes when it fires at one of the nodes with any light based weapon or tool. This graph of the Altars' locations, if scaled and overlaid atop CT-41's Map, would precisely match the physical locations of the Altars.</p>

				<p>When CT-41 chooses a node, the Altar produces a cylindrical energy seal, nearly as wide as the base of the Altar, that completely encloses the Altar's monolith, and reaches up to the roof of the chamber. Within this cylinder powerful pumps begin to whir, and briefly create a near vacuum. The Altar then produces a low pitched hum of increasing volume and begins to glow slightly as it opens a Tear, after which CT-41 instantly arrives at the destination Altar, which is similarly glowing. The destination Altar also produces a vacuum seal before receiving the Caretaker, and the seal drops soon after CT-41 arrives and atmospheric pressure is equalized.</p>

				<p>CT-41 can teleport to all the Altars that it has found and cleared. By using these Altars CT-41 is able to move quickly through the Underground, but perhaps more importantly, CT-41 is now able to teleport to the Diggings, an area at the base and to the west of the Deep Access Elevator in the Secure Wing of the Farsight Colony. Here the Farsight Expedition's archaeological team discovered ancient Native Ruins, and an Altar. CT-41 is at last able to return to the surface, after having been trapped in the Underground since falling down the Fuel Dump's borehole.</p>

				<p>CT-41 is currently unable to teleport to most Altars, and must clear away debris, creatures, cargo, water, cooled magma, sediments, or otherwise activate Altars to use them. As CT-41 moves through the Undergound, and uses the displays of operational Altars to pinpoint the locations of new Altars, it activates the once inoperable Altars and begins to use them as well. The only Altar not shown on an Altar's interactive display is the Prime Altar in the Outsider's Laboratory. Unlike in most rooms, changes made to Altar chambers by CT-41 are permanent. This way CT-41 does not have to clear the rooms every time it wishes to use them, and CT-41 can sensibly teleport to cleared destination Altars.</p>

				<p>The first Altar CT-41 teleports to is the Altar in the Diggings. When CT-41 arrives it finds itself atop an Altar surrounded by sensory equipment and small tools such as rock hammers, brushes, vacuums, and the like. Dust hangs heavy and somewhat stagnant in the air. It is able to move from this Altar chamber down into an area of primitive Native dwellings called the Ruins. The Ruins were only partially excavated by the Farsight Expedition's incredibly cautious and meticulous archaeological team, and CT-41 is able to move through into new chambers using the Sonic Auger. From the Diggings CT-41 is also able to return to the Farsight Colony, where it finds itself at the base of the Deep Access Elevator.</p>

				<p>After CT-41 walks through the door into the Colony from the Diggings, the door remains open. CICI send CT-41 a message.</p>

				<p>CICI: <em>"Welcome back Caretaker! I noticed that you entered the colony from the archaeological diggings. The door you which came through requires a Lieutenant Commander's rank card to open from inside the colony. Though I lack permissions to override carded doors for you, I was able to cut power to the door after it opened, so that it will not close. You should be able to enter the diggings in the future, even without a Lieutenant Commander's rank card."</em>.</p>

				<p>Unbeknownst to CT-41, after powering the Altars on, two new beings enter the universe. One comes from a future Truth, and one from the Outside. When power is first restored to the Underground, the Outsider enters Truth II from a future called Truth I. He arrives at an Altar near the Ancestral Halls, moves into the Explorer's shrine, sets up a 'trap' for CT-41, places his mind in order, and dies.</p>

				<p>The highly changed Vadim Kozlov also reenters Creation through an Altar when CT-41 restores power. He then moves to the Hermit's Cave on the Mountainside, far from the influence of Thosmodeme or Voronash. The first time CT-41 uses an Altar, the last rendered frame CT-41 sees before teleporting is a bright silouhette of a bearded man.</p>

				<p>The scope of CT-41's exploration expands again after the Altars are activated, and its journey becomes much less linear. CT-41 now has various avenues for exploration and efficient backtracking. CT-41 will encounter new hazards, such as automated Native machinery, defensive systems and robots, and new lifeforms.</p>

				-->

				<p>As CT-41 explores the Lumene Underground it will encounter eight Altars, each roughly corresponding to a Native Lineage. All the Alters except the one found in the Ruins will have to be cleared of some impediment to operation.</p>

				<div class="indented-list">
					<p>The Explorers' Altar was constructed in the Ruins, as an homage to the Explorers' ancestral home, and the injustice of their banishment to the Badlands. The Altar was cleared of sediment by members of the Farsight Expedition's archaeological team.</p>

					<p>The Warriors' Altar was constructed near the Desolation, rather than near their locus, as a tribute to their Sacrifice. CT-41 must clear sediment and rubble from the Altar before using it.</p>

					<p>The Healers' Altar was constructed near the Surgical Complex, to allow for the rapid treatment of patients with medical emergencies. During the Slaughter many Natives became trapped in this Altar chamber and were killed here. CT-41 must clear the Altar of Native and Servant remains.</p>

					<p>The Farmers' Altar was constructed near their upper Root Fields. After the Slaughter the Root Fields were untended, and an Overgrowth formed on the Altar. CT-41 must clear the Overgrowth from the Altar before it can be used.</p>

					<p>The Rulers' Altar was constructed near the Repository. During the Subjugation, the Rulers' Locus was flooded with boiling water, and the Altar's chamber was half flooded as well. CT-41 must drain the chamber before it can use the Altar.</p>

					<p>The Engineers's Altar was constructed near the Geothermal Power Station. Since the Slaughter, a Vermin infestation has affected much of the Engineers' Locus, and wiring to the Altar was damaged. CT-41 must complete the circuit providing power to the Engineers' Altar before using it.</p>

					<p>The Prime Altar in the Outsider's Laboratory is not connected to the regular teleport system. CT-41 must enter the Laboratory, kill the Outsider, and capture Voronash in the Necrolith before using the Prime Altar.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Once CT-41 has cleared all the normal Altars, the completed network will be visible.</p>
