				<p>After CT-41 defeats the Stone Giant, the boulders that it holds together fall away from its body, and come to rest on the floor of its chamber. CT-41 is able to move these stones, and place them on top of each other in order to climb out of the Stone Giant's abode. When it leaves, CT-41 sees that it has risen above the level of the clouds, and reached the Peak. The skies here are clear, and at night the stars shine brightly. The stone of the Peak is weathered and smooth, and only simple vegitation and wispy, delicate floating lifeforms are present.</p>

				<p>CT-41's journey up the Mountainside ends when it falls into the Caldera, whose steep western slope it cannot hope to climb. At the eastern end of the Caldera is a dark and ominous opening. CT-41 enters, and begins to move through smooth walled passages, toward a distant source of light. The light is seemlingly glancing off gently moving waters, and reflecting through the cave's passages. Every time CT-41 turns a corner, the lights grows brighter.</p>

				<p>CT-41 eventually enters a Hermit's Cave, simply furnished with a bed, a chair, a shelf, and a table, all carved from stone, and all in harmony with the natural flow of the stone of the chamber. The shelf holds several books, and one book is currently opened on the table. There is a pool near the eastern edge of the room, reflecting the lights emanating from a fire near the center of the room, and from a hunched and elderly bearded man. The man is seated on the stool, facing away from the table and the book, as if waiting for CT-41 to walk into his room.</p>

				<p>As CT-41 has had its BCU removed, it can attempt to attack the man sitting on the simple stone chair. However, any such attacks are completely ineffectual. After entering the room, CT-41 has the option to move toward the man, and speak to him.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Being: <em>"Hello again, Caretaker."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">Caretaker: <em>"What are you?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Being: <em>"I am not sure what I am anymore, but I know you. I come from this Creation, but I am thrown outside Walls, very long time ago. I am more now, than before. Please call me Vadim."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">Caretaker: <em>"What are the walls?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Being: <em>"Walls? The Walls of Creation! They separate Creation from all that is Outside."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">Caretaker: <em>"What lies beyond the Walls of Creation?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Vadim: <em>"All possible things. Creation is bright, precious tree, growing in dark and endless forest of the Real."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">Caretaker: <em>"What are you reading?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Vadim: <em>"Oh, you see my books... I try to read 'The Brothers Karamazov', but I never get far. I spend many years here. Every day I tell myself, 'Vadim, you should read these books. Mother gives them to you.' But always there is other thing to do, other thoughts."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">Caretaker: <em>"I am on a mission to defeat a great evil. Do you know anything of the entity called Voronash?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Vadim: <em>"This creature, and the pretender who he consumes, are not born naturally into Creation. Beyond walls live strange and powerful beings. I call them 'Singularities'. These draw others into themselves, and become more. I encounter, and escape, many Singularities when I am Outside. But Walls of Creation are strong. Singularity can only enter when they are torn from inside.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Know this: It is blessing to live in universe of freedom, and law. Selves are separate; boundaries are sacred. But the Enemy is outsider, stranger. Without beginning or end, he exists in chaos, consuming, so he is not consumed. He IS his hunger. His nature is not compatible with Nature. Your experience in Creation does not prepare you for him. Nature's weapons cannot hurt him now. As a being who is not invited into Creation, he never agrees to Creator's... uh... terms and conditions. He bends the Law until it breaks."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">Caretaker: <em>"What is Creation? Who is the Creator"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Vadim: <em>"Creation is almost Singularity, but is righteous king, not tyrant or predator, who sits on Creation's throne. When I am first Outside, I am confused, and afraid. Outside is... strange. Truth and existence is... fluid, simultaneous. Strange Demons chase me. I run, and change. To strange realities I escape, but at the end of all causal chains I am trapped. Demons begin to tear at my Self. Naked and defenseless, I have no hope left, and I call out to my Creator.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Light shines in darkness, and Demons flee. This Light beckons, and I follow. White doors open, and I enter Creator's Home. He gives me a Gift of sacred knowledge. I know, surely, that his justice and wisdom are as great as his power. He defends his Creation, and it grows, while Enemies throw themselves pointlessly against its walls.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"To and from Creator flow truth, and freedom, and Law. Many beings, lost like me, accept his offer of Selfhood, and enter into his Creation. Mighty structure forms, and grows forever, conquering without compulsion the vastness of the Real.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"But Enemy, who cannot challenge Creator directly, tries to weaken Creation from inside. He wants to bring all its stones, and the Eye of Light, toppling down.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Creator tells me I may stay in his Home, or return to finish. I wish to stay with him, but I know it is right to leave. I wait for you to open the Walls again, and I return. I come here, to wait for you, and your Companion."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">Caretaker: <em>"Will you help me fight Voronash?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Vadim: <em>"I cannot fight Enemy. His power is much greater than other Singularities I encounter. If he catches me, he grows stronger. I hide from him in this lonely cave, and here he does not see me.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"But Vadim is not lazy. He is always working. I know much of Creation, and much of its Enemy. I think hard thoughts, for long time, while I wait for you, and in my mind I think how to humble even the mighty Voronash..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Receive the Lawgiver! Use it to break those who break Law!"</em></p>

				<p>Vadim purposefully rises from his chair. It is the first time CT-41 has seen Vadim Kozlov standing, and he is noticeably taller than CT-41. Vadim grabs a stone from the floor and tosses it into the fire, which begins to blaze with incredible heat. The stone turns red, orange, yellow and white, and then begins to change shape. Once it has formed completely, Vadim reaches into the fire and grabs the object, before quenching it in the water of his pool. Steam rises, and the object takes on its lasting appearance, though its light never fully fades.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Vadim: <em>"I am finished now, Caretaker. I go back now, to the Home of Light. Goodbye, and good luck!"</em></p>

				<p>Vadim staggers back to his chair and sits. He bows his head and slowly fades away, and the fire in the room goes out, but the Lawgiver still glows. CT-41 takes it, and descends down the Mountainside. As it does, it notices that all the fires it passed on the way up have gone out.</p>

				<p>When CT-41 returns to the Fortuna Crater, it notices that several things have changed during the many Turns of its journey. The Argo and the Farsight Colony's external facilities are extremely worn. There are holes in the Argo, and sediments have entered from the tops and sides. Lumene lifeforms have made homes in the Water Tank and in the Cargo Hold. During day, light from Lumen shines in, but there is no internal power.</p>

				<p>The Farsight Colony is also dark and without power. CT-41 can still navigate through its facilities using the Tunneler, but can no longer speak to CICI. Dust and corrosion are visible on the Paralus' hull. As CT-41 moves into the Underground, it notices that the lifeforms of the Womb, the Sea, the Farmland and the Frontier are all gone.</p>
