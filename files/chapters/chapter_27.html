				<p>After leaving the Paralus, and with the Tunneler equipped, CT-41's exploratory options increase dramatically. CT-41 looks through the many markers it has placed on its Map, and returns to areas of the Underground it previously visited, to scour them for Items and Materials. CT-41 increases in power, and readies itself for the final act of its journey.</p>
				
				<p>Until this point in time, CT-41 has had purpose given to it, or at least a limited number of avenues of advance. It was supposed to discover the fate of the Farsight colonists, or go to Thosmodeme after capturing his Fragments, or break into the Colony, or prevent the Paralus from leaving Lumen 2. Now there is no direction. CT-41 can move to many new areas of Lumen 2, some which do not directly push it toward any concrete objective. Trusting its instincts, CT-41 looks to its Map, and goes to those region that are still dark.</p>

				<p>One section of its Map that is conspicuously blank is the upper west. CT-41 recalls the Openings that it could not previously ascend, and moves toward them. With the Tunneler, CT-41 is able to move onto the top of the stuck western lift, and climb up the Openings. It moves as needed from one Opening to the other, into piping to the east, and into a maintenance tunnel to the west, and gradually ascends.</p>

				<p>The Openings have become infested with a variety of Lumene organisms, which CT-41 uses, ignores or destroys as it moves up. Once it has almost reached the surface, CT-41 finds a passageway leading west, and if it continues just a little further, it finds a tunnel leading east to the Desolation. CT-41 finds a small elevator stuck at the top the maintenance tunnel, and dislodges it with Sonic Auger. With the maintenance elevator now active, CT-41 can now easily move through the entire operational height of the Openings, and summon the elevator to any level.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Their Houses Shall Be Made A Dunghill</div>

				<p>CT-41 takes the elevator back down to the passage leading west, and enters the Badlands. It passes through a heavy rusted gate using the Tunneler, and begins to move through the Locus of the Punished Explorers. The habitations it sees at the entrance to the Badlands are poorly excavated and furnished, and lighting is irregular or entirely out. The area is filled with the dust of neglect rather than the dust of antiquity.</p>

				<p>At the end of the passage leading west, CT-41 runs into a rusted door, apparently barricaded from behind with stones, beams, and trash. It cannot destroy the door, or Tunnel through it, so CT-41 looks for another path west. In one of the squalid Native habitations CT-41 discovers a dry and dirty crevice leading down and west.</p>
				
				<p>CT-41 moves into this tunnel, and eventually arrives at the first of several Waste Chambers. These are undesirable, dry caverns, filled with garbage produced by the Remnant. There are many large pieces of garbage in the Waste Chamber, and blocks of compressed trash produced in the Recycling Plant. CT-41 uses its arsenal to blast its way through the trash, filthy waters, and pests that inhabit the Waste Chambers. When it finally reaches the westernmost end of the Chamber, CT-41 finds a large waste chute, and moves up into the Recycling Plant.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">The Stone Which The Builders Rejected</div>

				<p>In the Recycling Plant CT-41 passes through clanging and rusty equipment which mistakes it for trash to be compacted. CT-41 notices many shallow carts carrying twisted beams, paneling, and large bundles of scrap metal that appear to have been brought from the Desolation. CT-41 also sees several more chutes leading down to the Waste Chamber, bins into which different materials are separated and stored, and conveyors that would be carrying refuse.</p>

				<p>CT-41 is accosted throughout the Recycling Plant, by creatures of filth that rise up from the Waste Chambers, by Native Pest Control drones, and by tentacular appendages that lash out from it from the ductwork. CT-41 works its way past all these obstacles, and continues east until it reaches the barricaded door to the Badlands' waste management facilities. It uses its tools to permantently destroy the barricade, allowing easier access to and passage through the Badlands.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Touch Not The Unclean Thing</div>

				<p>CT-41 can now move up into the Incinerator or to the Atmospheric Control Facility. It chooses to move to the Atmospheric Control Facility, a cleaner region containing chillers, boilers, fans, cooling towers, pumps, and extensive tubing and ductwork. Only a few fans are currently active, producing currents that either aid or impede CT-41 in its explorations. As in the rest of the Badlands, electrical power is uncertain, and CT-41 must occasionally use its Volt Gun to power the devices it encounters.</p>

				<p>CT-41 must still avoid or destroy Pest Control, and begins to encounter larger tentacles reaching out at it from the high diameter ductwork. After navigating the maze-like tubing and control rooms, CT-41 finally falls into a large chamber connected to much of the piping and vents of the Badlands, and sees the Tumor. This large disgusting mass of writhing tissue has the aspect of a heart and a stomach, and sits on a platform at the eastern end of the chamber, and has various thick tentacles reaching out into the Badlands. Its slimes and membranes cling to the walls and platforms of the chamber.</p>

				<p>The Tumor releases corrosive clouds of gas that deal persistent damage to CT-41. If CT-41 moves too close to the Tumor, it flails disgusting club-like tentacles, dealing heavy damage to CT-41 on impact. The tumor has several orifices, and periodically belches out slime that clings to CT-41, slowing its movement. CT-41 defeats the Tumor by destroying the tentacles that reach out into the Badlands. When a tentacle is destroyed the Tumor periodically builds up pressure in the weeping stump and fires small creeping Metastases at CT-41. These creatures fly across the chamber, dealing damage on contact, and then ooze toward CT-41 until destroyed.</p>

				<p>When CT-41 destroys all the appendages, it exposes the main body of the Tumor, and begins to attack it. The Tumor responds with powerful charged attacks from a previously hidden appendage within its throbbing folds, while continuing to launch its other attacks. Once CT-41 deals enough damage, the sagging Tumor bursts in a mess of fleshy tissue and fluids. Various remains, trash, slime and an Item fall from its belly. CT-41 moves toward and collects the Item, an Electron Well, and its battery capacity increases.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">In The Furnace Of Affliction</div>

				<p>With the Tumor dead, CT-41 now has the option to move through several new passageways once its tentacles shrivel to nothingness. Air is able to flow through new ducts, and CT-41 moves through them into the Incinerator. CT-41 navigates through the furnaces and flame pits, up toward the blackened filtration system. Using the Tunneler and other Tools, CT-41 moves through several layers of sediment caked filters and hatches before finally emerging onto the western lip of the Fortuna Crater.</p>
