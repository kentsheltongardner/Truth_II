				<p>After a long moment of darkness, a Caretaker automaton called CT-41 awakens in Truth III. It hears the voice of its mother, Jessica Arai. It learns to speak, and to move. It explores the Argo, and speaks to the awakened Farsight expeditionaries it meets. CT-41 finally speaks to Captain Garrett, who gives it a mission to scare off or destroy all unintelligent life in the eastern edge of the Fortuna Crater. CT-41 speaks to Otis Cobb and receives an Industrial Laser before exiting the Argo via its eastern loading ramp. CT-41 moves across the surface of Lumen 2, scattering the lifeforms it encounters until it reaches a small recess in the Crater wall. Up to this moment all events have unfolded as they did in Truth II.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves into the dark recess, and sees a dimly glowing yellow figure at the back of the cave. As CT-41 moves closer, it sees the young Outsider, who will be the first intelligent alien known to humanity. Behind the outsider is an inactive Caretaker, its appearance altered by many powerful upgrades. CT-41 may attempt to attack the Outsider, who shrugs off its attacks with his shields.</p>

				<p>CT-41 approaches the Native, and speaks to him.</p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I am CT-41, a Caretaker automaton. What are you?"</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"Hello Caretaker. I am the Outsider, a native of this world. Do you see the device behind me?</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Yes."</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"It is a Caretaker automaton, very much like yourself... Though its carbon lattice brain was destroyed long ago, its sensory logs survived. Do you wish to see what it saw in life?"</p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Yes."</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"Behold!"</p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Tell It To The Generation Following</div>

				<p>The Outsider opens the inactive Caretaker's fron access hatch, and presses several buttons. Immediately affterward, the viewscreen is replaced by one that says 'Log Synch in progress'. A progress bar appears at the bottom of the screen, and CT-41 begins to view many of the events that transpired in the former Caretaker's journey, exactly as they occurred. As the selected events play out, the progress bar fills, and the credits for Truth II are presented as an overlay.</p>

				<p>During the upload, CT-41 witnesses the following events from Truth II:</p>

				<div class="indented-list">

				<p>Once the standard events are displayed and all the credits have been presented, CT-41 may see several more happenings from Truth III, depending on which Companions it acquired during its journey.</p>

				<div class="indented-list">
					<p>Builder(Laborer) - The Outsider watches Engineers and Laborers as they lay the foundations for their Locus in the Briar Patch.</p>

				</div>

				<p>Certain groupings of Companions will produce new events as well.</p>

				<div class="indented-list">

					<p>Stargazer and Linguist - The Outsider watches as the Stargazer points out a system on a star chart.</p>

					<p>All Companions - The Outsider and his father lead the Explorers out of the Settlements.</p>

				</div>

				<p>Once these events have all been shown, CT-41 regains physical control of himself, and Captain Garrett gives it an order.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Garrett: <em>"CT-41, we have been ordered by the Administration to deactivate and disassemble all our Caretaker automata. However, in light of your encounter with an intelligent alien creature, and the presence of another Caretaker already on this world, I am disregarding that order. Report to me on the command deck, and we will begin an analysis of the sensor logs you received."</p>

				<p>The screen goes black, and the menu screen appears, this time showing an illuminated Lumen 2, with Lumen risen high above it.</p>

				<small>"Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness."</small>
