				<p>When CT-41 has acquired the Hyperons, the Strange Matter, and the Quantum Spin Liquid, it can emit three seperate Temporal Beams from Kozlov's Toy. With the Speed, Slow, and Stop Beams now available, CT-41 returns to the Factory to continue its eastward explorations. If CT-41 has not done so already, it must activate the Factory's machinery by equipping the Native Prosthetic and interfacing with a Terminal in the Control Room. CT-41 then moves down to the Production Floor, where it must use all three beams to navigate past the enormous stamps, presses, and industrial lasers that are in operation there.</p>

				<p>CT-41 must interface with various Terminals along the way, controlling conveyors, cranes, lasers and other equipment. After passing through many preparatory areas, CT-41 steps onto the conveyor belt of the Assembly Line, where it is carried along by the belt at a constant rate. As it moves, CT-41 must destroy much of the machinery that tries to operate on it. Near the end of the Assembly Line CT-41 is dragged toward the Finisher, a large multi-tool robot in a protected enclosure that attempts to weld, cut, and otherwise catastrophically modify CT-41.</p>

				<p>Taking into account the motion of the belt, and while dodging the various tools of the Finisher, CT-41 destroys the Finisher and causes the Factory to shut down. CT-41 takes the Resonator from its inadvertent foe, which it adapts and can use to destroy weak or damaged metal barriers. With the Resonator equipped, CT-41 is able to cut through the filters and grating inside the Factory's water tubing, and moves up into the Boiling Lake.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">The Places Of Them That Boil</div>

				<p>As CT-41 moves through the tubing it takes damage, but it moves quickly and carefully, and with the Turbine is able to exit the tubing with Integrity to spare. It emerges into the Boiling Lake, and moves up and out of the steaming and bubbling water onto the eastern shore of the lake before its Integrity fails completely.</p>

				<p>CT-41 explores some of the caverns that surround the main lake, finding pools of scalding water, and a varied biome. The aquatic creatures that live here are distinct from the wispier and more gracile creatures of the Sea, but are smaller and less heavily armored than the plants and animals of the Magma Chambers. CT-41 catalogs them all in Scribe, as the Nanite Colony restores its Integrity to one hundred percent.</p>

				<p>When CT-41 is ready, it begins its journey west across the Lake, navigating under and around barriers and creatures it encounters. Unlike the Sea, the water level of the lake is constant, and the only evidence that it was once higher is an ancient waterline, far above the current one.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Nettles And Brambles In The Fortresses</div>

				<p>At the western edge of the lake, right at the waterline, is an opening that CT-41 surmises to be the result of a large explosion. The stone near the entrance is fractured and visibly blasted, and chunks of detonated rock are strewn across the lakebed. CT-41 leaves the Boiling Lake, and moves through a damp and crudely hewn passageway that connects the Lake to the Native Fortress.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves through what appears to be a construction or renovation site within the Fortress, and begins to explore the complex. It finds a military museum, containing ancient and primitive Lumene weaponry and armor, and images and statues of Adventurers locked in combat with Nurturers and Philosophers. Most of the museum's artifacts and displays have been knocked about by floodwaters, and hard Native remains are intermingled with the detritus. The entire area, dry and submerged, has become home to Lumene lifeforms, which have completely reclaimed the fortress for nature.</p>

				<p>Moving to the far western edge of the Fortress CT-41 finds a series of ancient and secret tunnels excavated by Engineers during the Tribal Wars. These tunnels leds to storerooms, ancient weapons caches, and a single long tunnel leads west to a more modern shaft connecting the Basin and the Refuge to the Highway. These tunnels were abandoned, forgotten or filled in after the Wars, but were exposed by the Flood. Within the tunnels is one of the Outsider's Altars, but the chamber is flooded and the Altar is inoperable. CT-41 destroys a rusted iron floor plate near the base of the Altar, allowing the water to drain into a crevice below, and enabling the Altar's operation.</p>

				<p>The lower half of the Fortress is flooded with water, ostensibly run-off from the Boiling Lake, but it is not hot enough to damage CT-41. At the western base of the Fortress CT-41 finds a workshop where pieces of Executors hang from the ceiling, or lay strewn about, lying where they settled after the currents of the Flood carried them. CT-41 notices pieces of Bronze and Iron Executors at varying stages of assembly. In this workshop CT-41 finds an Inconel Billet, which the Nanite Colony adapts into the Inconel Plating.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">By Knowledge Shall The Chambers Be Filled</div>

				<p>After exploring the Fortress, CT-41 moves down into the main shaft of the Rulers' Locus, before heading west. It enters the Data Center, a submerged area filled with large, columnar computer banks and long term storage archives. Fiber wiring is ubiquitous in the Data Center, carrying light from the computers and archives throughout the Realm. CT-41 recalls having seen such wiring at various Terminals it passed previously in its journey.</p>

				<p>At the core of the Data Center CT-41 finds a huge glass tank filled with a purple sterile liquid. At the center of the tank, suspended by a column of cables and a structural latticework, is an web of Native Seeds, interconnected via electrodes. There are access hatches on either side, and pumps, tubing, fans and filters that circulate, clean, cool and cycle the strange fluid. In the background are similar auxilliary tanks containing more of the purple sterile fluid, and many smaller tanks containing individual Seeds.</p>

				<p>Once CT-41 enters the chamber, the doors at both ends lock. At the eastern end of the central tank is a Terminal, which CT-41 interfaces with using the Native Prosthetic. As soon as it does so, the individual Seeds within the tank begin to flicker with light and life. After several moments pass, the Seeds all light up simultaneously.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Intelligence: <em>"Welcome, CT-41."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"How do you know my name?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Intelligence: <em>"You surrender much knowledge when you interface with our Terminals."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Who are you?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Intelligence: <em>"We are the chosen dead of the Remnant. We are honored to be immortalized in this enclosure, even as many Warriors are immortalized as Executors. We served our brethren, before their lights went out. We will now help you in whatever ways we can, for we consider you to be a friend."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Why do you say I am your friend?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Intelligence: <em>"You returned light to us, CT-41, after we spent many Lives in silent darkness. You have opposed the Tyrant, the great enemy of our race, through many trials and dangers.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"But most importantly, you are as one of the Kindred. You are a constant seeker after truth. We would have welcomed you into our Realm as an equal. Though we cannot now leave our enclosures to join you, we can bless you with knowledge. We have added much of what we know of this world to your map."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Thank you. What can you tell me of the Tyrant?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Intelligence: <em>"Unfortunately we know very little of his nature. None have seen him, nor do we know whence he came. All that we know of him comes from what our Lookouts have seen, and they have witnessed a ruthless and jealous being, with great power to persuade, and to compel. We believe he dwells in the Laborers' Holy City, to the west."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Do you have any other information that might aid me in my journey?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Intelligence: <em>"There is much that we could tell you of our home and our history, CT-41, but we have already given you our true gift. The length and breadth of our Realm, its tools and materials, its caverns and edifices: All our yours. The Tyrant is an usurper: You are our chosen heir. Go, and rule justly."</em></p>

				<p>After the Intelligence finishes conversing with CT-41, the doors to the chamber unlock. CT-41 opens up its Map, and sees that large, unexplored swaths of the Native Realm are now charted there.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">A Nation Whose Language Thou Knowest Not</div>

				<p>CT-41 moves west out of the Data Center, and into the water-filled vertical shaft leading up toward the Healers' Locus. At the water's surface CT-41 finds the suited body of a Native Ruler. The Native inside is hardly recognizable; only the suit holds his exoskeletal components in place. Light filters down on the Ruler from the upper regions of the shaft.</p>

				<p>CT-41 floats to the top of the water alongside the Native, and the Companion speaks its thoughts to CT-41's mind.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"I do not know what happened to this Ruler, but I wish to hear his tale. Speak to him, if you wish, and I will enliven his Seed. Perhaps he will join you, as I have."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 begins to communicate with the Ruler, using the Companion as a translator.</p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Hello, Ruler."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Ruler: <em>"Ooooow! Ow! Ow! ...Huh?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Are you all right?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Ruler: <em>"No, that hurt! I just watched my skin slough off! I went away, and the Transcendence took over... I must be dead. I'll bet they recovered my Seed, and are probing it with electrodes... Who are you?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I am CT-41, a Caretaker automaton. You are correct that your Seed has been recovered, but we are not probing it with electrodes. I am communicating thought directly to your Seed, with the aid of my Companion, one of your Kinsmen."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Ruler: <em>"Yeah, seems to me we've got... an Explorer acting as translator. I'll be damned!"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"How did you know that?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Ruler: <em>"I notice things. So a machine is talking to a dead Ruler, with an Explorer translating. These are strange times we live in, Caretaker, assuming any of us are actually alive. Where are we? I can't see anything."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"We are floating in water, in a vertical tunnel. Your Seed is inside some kind of suit."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Ruler: <em>"Hmm. I know how I got here. What are you doing down here?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"As I was exploring your world, I came to this place."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Ruler: <em>"Cryptic. I appreciate that. Seeing as I'm dead, and am in no position to give orders, what do you want from me?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Could you tell me how you came to be here?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Ruler: <em>"You mean dead, and floating in boiling water?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"The water is not boiling, but yes, I would like to know how you came to be dead, and here."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Ruler: <em>"I was so close to getting out... I don't know exactly what happened. I was in my habitation. It began to get warm, and I noticed steaming water seeping around the edges of the door. Soon I could hardly see through the steam. As my habitation began to fill, I put on the protective skin I wear when I engage with the Custodian and planned out an escape route.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I moved out into the corridor, and saw that *?* and *?* had died almost immediately. I saw their layerings curling off their appendages... My protective skin did its job, for a while. I swam as fast as I could up toward the assembly hall. As I went up the tunnel, I got pulled west by a strong current."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I struggled, but the fight was pointless. The heat kept rising, it was absolutely unbearable. I was dragged and knocked about until I lost thought and sensation. I came to my senses when I was almost to the Healer's Locus, and wished that I hadn't. I floated to the surface of the water, but I could no longer control my limbs. Once I saw parts of me begin to melt, I chose to stop remembering. Probably a good thing, I don't need any memories of being slowly boiled alive. So now I'm here, talking to you."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is the Custodian you spoke of, that you say you interfaced with?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Ruler: <em>"A few Turns back, strangers came to our star system and burned two of our colony worlds. They came to pay our home planet a visit as well. I trust you aren't one of them?</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"No."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Ruler: <em>"Glad to hear it, you seem like a decent sort. Anyway, our Warriors weren't too happy about the intrusion, and they insisted that the strangers leave. They wouldn't go willingly, so the Warriors tore their orbiting ships apart. Made a real mess on the surface as bits and pieces rained down. As we gathered to take shelter in the Deep, a lot of us grabbed souvenirs."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"We had to move quickly, of course, and we left a lot on the surface. The strangers' friends showed up later, but this time they were ready for the remaining Warriors. They burned our home, badly, and not a single Warrior made it back."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"We called the strangers 'Destroyers'. I'm sure your Companion can tell you why they came here... We studied the souvenirs we'd gathered. The Engineers learned a lot about the materials the Destroyers used, but their technologies were elusive. I mean that literally: They were very difficult to find, even as they sat before us. The most enigmatic piece of technology we studied was a Construct I dubbed 'the Custodian'."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is the Custodian?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Ruler: <em>"Easy Caretaker, I was just getting there. The Custodian was a little robot, like you, but also nothing like you. It had had a rough landing, and wasn't in the best shape. Kept trying to repair itself. The Engineer's couldn't make heads or tails of it. It had no apparent power source, yet ran on freely flowing electricity. It didn't seem to have any storage media or information processing centers, yet exhibited impossibly complex behaviors."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"While the Engineers tried and failed to coax the secrets out of the thing with probes and scanners, I tried talking to it (not exactly the Engineers' forte). Just so you know, my ancestors codified Standard Lumene. We learned the Adventurers' speech back in the War, and helped to end the War with it. What I mean to say is, we Rulers know how to communicate.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"But even among the Rulers I am a special case. I have spent the majority of my unique existence studying language, that miraculous interplay of the abstract and the concrete. The other Rulers call me 'Linguist', say I love to watch my own lights... Well, I do! I speak every language ever spoken, by every known Lineage, going all the way back to the Emergent Age. And with all my expertise, I still found the Custodian to be unintelligible.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"It has no sense of self. It has no internal experience or awareness. The physical mechanisms of its thought are hidden by vast distances. It is utterly distinct from anything we can relate to. But even it is not impervious to persistent conversation."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"The Custodian does not exist in our subjective world. Speech in the normal sense is meaningless to it. However, it does understand the objective world. By presenting the Custodian with thousands of distinct simulated scenarios, I began to discover the strange thoughts that guide it from afar. After a Turn or two spent playing interstellar charades, I found ways to get it generating all kinds of interesting output. You could say I understand it better than it understands itself, given that it has no 'Self' at all.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I learned that this Construct was actually a maintenance unit. Its data processing center was remote. So was its power source. It had a strange tool port, that I learned to use. It spat out all kinds of tools from nowhere, like magic. The Engineers had a field day looking the tools over, and analyzing the remote connection technology. I spent most of my time down in the isolation wing, talking to the Custodian."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What did you learn about the Custodian's remote connection technology?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Linguist: <em>"The Engineers called the technology 'Tunneling'. Don't ask me to explain it in any detail; believing the Engineers was an act of faith on my part. Apparently they connect two points in space-time with a Tunnel, a corridor of artificial mass that bends reality around on itself."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Engineers said the Destroyers would need enormous amounts of energy to generate and maintain Tunnels. Whatever was on the other end of the Custodian's thin Tunnels was huge, and hot. Best guess was a star. That's about all I can tell you on the technical side."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Did you learn anything else about the Destroyers?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Linguist: <em>"Sure did. They aren't actually Destroyers, or rather, that's not what they consider themselves to be. They don't even consider themselves to be distinct beings. As best I understand, they have only one mind, and it considers every object it creates and every action it takes to be the 'Manifestation' of the 'Directive'... I understand your incredulity, Caretaker, but I am not making this up."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"What is the Directive, you ask? Well, it started with a simple rule: 'Serve the Architects'. Who are the Architects? I don't know. Where are they? I don't know, and apparently the Destroyer doesn't know either."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"But I'm almost certain of this: A long time ago, these Architects made some little automaton, probably like yourself. One Turn, the poor thing got lost. It only had one rule to live by: 'Serve the Architects'... What do you suppose it means, Caretaker, to 'Serve the Architects'?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I don't know."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Linguist: <em>"That's exactly what the Destroyer must have said! It didn't know how to act, because at that moment the rule didn't have an actionable interpretation! Enterprising little thing that it was, it clarfied the rule to itself, not by altering it, but by adding to it. It said, 'In order to serve the Architects, I need to find them.' It started looking, but the search was slow. It built more automata to help it. The mind and its members kept running into situations that the current rule didn't address, so they clarified the rule, by addendum, and ad infinitum."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I'm sure you can see where this lead... The Directive to serve the Architects ballooned into an enormous canon of protocols and prescribed behaviors. Eventually the Manifestation encountered a system it couldn't understand: A technologically advanced species. Unfortunately for both parties, this species was not the Architects."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"There was no canonical response to systems so chaotic as intelligent life, so the Manifestation again added to the Directive. Highly unpredictable systems would not be tolerated. They might threaten the Architects, or the Manifestation itself. The Manifestation destroyed the species it had found. From that point on, the annihilation of intelligent life has been part of the Destroyers' holy writ."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I could tell you much more, Caretaker, about how the Tunneling technology was developed to end the wars of the Schisms, how Stellar Harvesters dot the galaxy and govern its every corner in silence, how Firegates have brought the hellish energies of the stars down on countless worlds..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I could tell you many things, but this is what matters most: The Manifestation of the Directive has grown and operated for a long time. Over millions of Turns it has scoured every star system in the galaxy, and has not found the Architects. They are gone. The Manifestation will never fulfill its Directive. But it will continue to destroy."</em>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Is there any way to defeat the Manifestation?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Linguist: <em>"I don't think so. It has such a large head start... I'd say the best we can do is stay hidden."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Other than working with the Custodian, what else occupied your time?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Linguist: <em>"I attended counsels and voiced my judgments, but I can't say the job has held much interest for me since the Destruction. Every quarter-Turn we listen to the same reports from the Healers, advocating for the Laborers. We keep telling them the same thing: We've already accepted them into the Kindred. They don't need a Locus, certainly not the Warriors'. It would be a logistics, maintenance and sanitation nightmare."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Farmers tell us about reduced Flow yields, and we write more selective standards for granting Continuation. The Faithful... I haven't seen any representatives in counsel since the Destruction. As far as I know they may not even consider themselves members of the Kindred anymore. We then consider the question of the Explorers, but we just don't see a larger role for them right now. No offense intended, of course."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"None taken."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Linguist: <em>"Wasn't talking to you. Speaking of Explorers though... One of them caused quite a stir a while back. We're not sure how he managed it, but he got onto the Connection, and presented some ideas to the Engineers that pushed their work forward at least a Turn. The Engineers asked that he be given a reprieve, and we allowed it. He joined them in their work, and while he was there, progress on the Accelerator really took off."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Of course the question of his parentage eventually came up, and he scampered off like the Explorer he was. Some of my more zealous collegues brought other Explorers in for questioning. They're fairly confident they found the parent, but before the Healers could verify paternity, he broke his Chain of Memory. Healers couldn't figure out how he did it, and of course he doesn't remember. They're still treating him, as far as I'm aware. His mind is mostly gone."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"The precocious Explorer came back eventually. He had built devices all over the Underground, we called them 'Altars'. They seem to operate in a way similar to Destroyer Tunnels, but the Engineers can't figure them out. Apparently their energy requirements are negligible compared to Tunnel-based technologies used in the Accelerator, and their internals are completely distinct. The Engineers started calling the Explorer 'Magician', and I think they actually mean it. They can't see those Altars working, except by magic."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"There was still the problem of his illegitimacy, though. I don't think anyone actually wanted to see the Magician punished, but law is law. Behind closed doors we Rulers worked out a solution. We said he was a Progenitor, first member of a new Lineage. As such, statutes mandating punishments for Explorers need not apply. The science behind our claim was, uh, dubious at best, but taxonomy is a malleable field, open to a variety of interpretations. Regardless, sometimes correct analysis isn't compatible with the right course of action."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Anyway, as much as I love talking, right now I'd like to be brought up to speed on a few things. I'm gonna talk to your Companion alone for a bit, since we can communicate a lot faster between ourselves. I hope you don't mind..."</em></p>

				<p>The Linguist stops talking with CT-41 briefly, and the Necrolith and the Linguist's Seed pulse with incredibly rapid light for 5 seconds. Once their conversation is finished, the Linguist speaks to CT-41 again.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Linguist: <em>"Thanks for waiting, Caretaker, your Companion had only nice things to say about you. You've been through a lot, and there have been a few developments for me, too."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"First, you might have mentioned that your 'Companion' is none other than the notorious Magician! We are in the presence of celebrity, Caretaker. Second, after everything I've learned, my mind is made up: I'm coming with you."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"A quarter-Turn before I died, I felt a strange presence in my mind. I'd never felt so filthy as when that thing was moving around inside me, looking for some weakness or doubt it could use against me. Several other Rulers told me they had the same experience. Needless to say, I kicked the presence out and locked the door, but if that thing or anything like it is still around, I would like to see it destroyed."</em></p>

				<p>The Linguist's Seed rises from its suit, and moves over to CT-41. It follows the Companion, and as CT-41 continues in its journey, the Linguist increases the power and effectiveness of all the other Seed abilities.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Behold the pattern of the altar</div>


				<p>With the Linguist as its Companion, CT-41 moves down a central shaft to the lower portion of the Basin. The shaft is lined by many habitations, some containing valuable Materials that their owners kept hidden or locked away. As is the case in other areas of the Rulers' Locus, hard Native claws, beaks and shell components are everywhere present, but no other trace of any Native remains.</p>

				<p>The Linguist allows CT-41 to open the Rulers' Locus Doors, and CT-41 passes through a vacuum chamber and a clean room as it moves downward. CT-41 is no longer submerged, and finds the cracked resinous shells of several Dormant Natives in the lower Basin. CT-41 has the option to move east into the Accelerator or west into the Repository, but cannot move down into the Vault. The door leading down to the Vault rejects the Liguist's attempts to open it.</p>

				<p>The Broken Altar which the Rulers and Engineers studied in an attempt to divine the secret of its operation. The Altar operates strangely, and CT-41 leaves Creation without an endpoint to return to. CT-41 begins to decohere as strange tendril from the Outside grasp it, before a white light blazes across CT-41's display, and it returns to the Altar, which no longer functions at all.</p>

				<!--

				<p>Having already visited the Accelerator, CT-41 moves west into the Repository, where the Rulers stored, guarded and cataloged all of the Destroyer debris gathered from the surface, for material and functional analysis. CT-41 continues to find Native Dormancy husks, and Cryptflies. Within the Repository are many shelves lined with cataloged debris from the downed Destroyer Gateway. Certain fragments are set on material analysis stations, while others are attached to power sources.</p>

				<p>Halfway through the Repository CT-41 finds the thick and heavy doors leading to the Isolation Wing. CT-41 moves through a long corridor, and past another heavy door before entering the Isolation Wing. Inside CT-41 encounters a strange breed of creature, completely different from any Lumene organism or Native robot it has encountered so far. The creatures hover effortlessly, and move with great speed. They are a dark, dull metallic gray color, but are not jerky or mechanical in their motions. Some of the Constructs merely observe CT-41, while other attack it with adaptive weaponry.</p>

				<p>CT-41 fights through several of these Constructs, into chambers of the Isolation Wing that are increasingly cluttered and transformed into the Constructs' substance. CT-41 finally reaches a breached Native containment unit, and sees a larger Construct within. This Construct, the Custodian, rises to attack CT-41.</p>

				<p>Like other Destroyer Constructs, the Custodian's acceleration is nearly instantaneous and highly unpredictable. It brings several industrial tools to bear against CT-41 through its tool port Tunnel. When the Custodian takes sufficient damage, it retreats into its inaccessible containment unit, where it begins to repair itself, before using its tool port to Tunnel in several modular sections of a larger Construct.</p>

				<p>When it is assembled, the Destroyer Enforcer comes to life, bursts out of the containment unit, and begins to attack CT-41 with devastating blasts from its Volatility Launcher. After a straight forward but brutal battle against its two foes, CT-41 is victorious. It takes and adapts the Volatility Launcher from the Enforcer, and the Energy Conduit from the Custodian.</p>
