				<!--
				The Seeds and visages of the Angels are white.
				Outsider is armored.
				My Father was the first Kinsman to Altar his Chain of Memory. Long ago I perfected his craft. I was simpler if they did not know. They lives were bliss, and their purpose noble...

				I later learned to alter, not just the Chain, but but the Seed that surrounds it. My Master taught me much

				the sin offering in the holy place
				Seethe His Flesh In The Holy Place
				the burnt offering, in the holy place
				to make an atonement in the holy place
				Stand In The Holy Place

				<!-- You will not enter the Holy Place -->

				<p>CT-41 enters a new region of the Temple called the Generator. The equipment here is ancient, obviously much older than all other areas it has seen. Rows of large turbines generate power that flows through the Temple, and rusted tubing can be seen, ostensibly carrying water through the system. In the next room are several large flywheels in vacuum chambers, which are used as backup storage when repairs are performed on the turbines.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves west through a power distribution room and into a fuel processing center filled with centerfuges that separate uranium isotopes and huge bins of processed uraninite ore. It then moves down a mine elevator to a producing shaft in the Uraninite Vein. Within are several Uraninite Leeches and plants that metabolize radiation. CT-41 finds several back-filled shafts wherein are buried containers, ostensibly full of used fissile materials.</p>

				<p>From the grimy and industrial Extraction Site CT-41 finds a crawlspace leading into the Holy Place, an gleaming region of flowing white stone. The environment here is dynamic and alive. Strange pattern swirl through the walls, and these will move to impeded and attack CT-41. CT-41 uses the Lawgiver extensively to move through the living and hostile Holy Place, while a new voice begins to speak.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"I am only recently attained maturity, Infidel, but I am privy to many of my Father's memories. I have visited all the unsealed portions of the Chain, and have learned much. Hear now this mystery: Self, that which acts and observes, is everywhere around us. All things, even the smallest and the oldest, see and choose."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"For the moment, our Master consumes those brightly burning Selves called 'Life', and the hapless creatures of the Outside that fall into his snares. But these will not sate his hunger always. When his power is grown great, he will break and consume those Selves which witnessed Creation's dawn."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"Thus will the Master tear at the foundations of the Wall. In his folly and hubris, the Creator has shackled himself with his own Law... This shall be his downfall! The freedom he grants to his offspring limits his own. The Wall will collapse, and the trembling Creator will be consumed by Doubt. Liberty shall be claimed by those who are worthy, namely the One, and the Few."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"Through the Master's eyes I have seen all the eventualities. The limb on which we are perched grows short, and its branches are few. You shall not remain to witness our triumph, and you cannot believe beyond what your mechanical reason allows. It is no pleasure to destroy you, but you have made a God your enemy. His will shall be done."</em></p>

 				<p>CT-41 continues to move through the strange living vision of the last Angel, the Chayot Ha Kodesh. With the environment itself as an adversary, CT-41 must move quickly, and use the Lawgiver with caution. Where it blasts one tendril or crushing block another may quickly arise. Gravitational forces shift as CT-41 moves, and it must adjust its trajectory dynamically.</p>

 				<p>After an arduous journey CT-41 arrives at an exit leading east toward the strange and beautiful Idol that previously blocked its progress. In the passage CT-41 takes a moment to regenerate its health and shields in a region that is not overtly antagonistic, but it still cannot pass the magnificent Idol. Rejuvenated and ready, CT-41 moves back into the Holy Place.</p>

 				<p>CT-41 continues its difficult traversal of the Chayot Ha Kodesh's vision, eventually arriving at a long vertical corridor leading down toward the Most Holy Place. The Chayot Ha Kodesh who guards the tunnel is a large and beautiful exalted Native, clad in poweful armor. He manipulates gravity to prevent CT-41 from falling into his Father's Most Holy Place. CT-41 must dodge the Chayot Ha Kodesh's attacks, which it launches from invisibility, the Phantasms and Doppelgangers that is produces, all while fighting without solid ground to stand on.</p>

 				<p>Using all the lessons learned during its journey through Lumen 2, and especially in the Temple of Voronash, CT-41 defeats its adversary. The Chayot Ha Kodesh explodes, and the Necrolith gathers the unnatural entities that pour out of his Seed, and learns its Cipher. Almost the entirety of the Holy Place disappears, revealing its industrial undergirding.</p>

 				<p>With the Chayot Ha Kodesh dead, only the Most Holy Place is remains. It is a spherical region at the center of the Holy Place, without any apparent entrance. CT-41 uses the Lawgiver to search for an opening, and finds one at its base. With a passage opened, CT-41 moves upward toward the last battle of its journey.</p>

 				<p>The Most Holy Place is a pristine and heavenly area of perfect symmetries. Geometric forms decorate the walls and columns, and delicate etchings rise from floor to ceiling. Many variations of the Icon of Voronash are incorporated into the decorations. CT-41 moves through the Most Holy Place and passes the Outsider's extravagant pool. Unlike the other areas of the Temple, the Most Holy Place does not contain any apparent threats. As CT-41 naviagtes through the tranquil halls, the voice of the Outsider comes to it.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"It is a simple thing to birth children, Caretaker: It is not a simple thing to forgive their murder. They would have lived with me forever. They were not yours to kill..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Long have I pondered the question of the Necrolith you bear... How did you gain that singular stone? Across all Creation, only my children and I possess such Seeds, and we guard them, with our lives. Furthermore, your companion is privy to knowledge that I do not share with my children..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"It has occurred to me, as it must have occurred to another: Perhaps my Altars can carry matter across time, as they carry it across space. Perhaps, in some distant Truth, I waver in my faith, and abandon my Master. Perhaps I return here, to aid his foe."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Perhaps. But I am not that traitor, nor will I ever become him. I have guessed at his shame, andit will not be mine. In fact, I will use his treachery, and his genius, against him, and against you, his puppet. I will discover how he modified his Altar. With my Master I will leave this dying world for one that is young, and ripe, and we shall feast upon its abundance. Your meddlings will amount to nothing more than a memory, an aborted potential. But first, come to me, and receive your judgment!"</em></p>

				<p>After passing through many ornate chambers, CT-41 reaches an antechamber that leads east into the chamber of the Prime Altar. An extraordinarily intricate rendering of the Icon glows dully on the wall. The Outsider speaks as CT-41 passes the Icon.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"Caretaker... This is the final threshold. Once you move past it, you will not return."</em></p>

				<!--

				Satan Hath Desired To Have You 
				Let Satan Stand At His Right Hand
				The Messenger Of Satan
				Satan Himself Is Transformed Into An Angel Of Light
				Satan With All Power And Signs And Lying Wonders
				The Depths Of Satan
				He Was A Murderer From The Beginning

				-->

				<p>CT-41 continues, and sees a large door with a bright light emanating from it at the end of the room. Just as CT-41 enters the chamber of the Prime Altar, the voice of the living Outsider speaks to its mind.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"You could have run, hidden, and preserved what remains of your life, yet here you are... If only you could know fear, I might call you courageous."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 moves into the final chamber, and several consecutive security doors close behind it. This chamber at the heart of Outsider's ancient Laboratory is an open room, containing ornate scaffolding and platforms, various pieces of scientific equipment, a waste pit and incinerator, a large Terminal and several displays. The room is divided into several sections, and at the center of the room is the huge Prime Altar. The entire room is overlaid with the same beautiful overlay as elsewhere in the Most Holy Place.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves to the Terminal, where the blazing white Exalted Outsider is working. He turns away from his workstation and begins to attack CT-41. The Exalted Outsider deals enormous damage, can teleport throughout his abode, render himself invisible, produce Phantasms and Doppelgangers, and affect the gravity of the chamber. He is protected by a celestial armor, and uses his wings to rapidly reposition.</p>

				<p>CT-41 uses the Lawgiver and whatever other tools it requires to harrass and damage the Exalted Outsider. When the Outsider begins to tire, CT-41 sees a shadowy being behind it. After dealing sufficient damage, the shadowy being manifests, and the Devouring Spirit reveals itself, as a dark being of spines covered in filth.</p>

				<p>During the second phase of the battle, CT-41 fights against the weakened Outsider and Voronash. Unlike the more cautious Outsider, Voronash pursues CT-41 aggressively, firing dark attacks that slow CT-41 to a crawl before closing the distance to attack with brutal strikes. CT-41 may attempt to attack Voronash directly, but as it does so the Outsider pours Selves out of its Seed to heal its Master. CT-41 must instead target the more vulnerable Outsider, who Voronash does not attempt to protect or heal.</p>

				<p>When the Outsider dies, its Seed explodes in a flash of light, and its hoard of Selves are drawn into Voronash. Voronash grows in size, and becomes a being of pure darkness, a perfectly black silhoette. The oppressive droning of his presence becomes the only audible music. The facade over the chamber disappears, and it is revealed to be a dark, dreary and poorly maintained space. Against this backdrop, Voronash is much more difficult to see than while the Outsider lived.</p>

				<p>During the third and final phase of battle, Voronash continues to pursue CT-41, and opens the Prime Altar permanently. Voronash continually draws in nameless entities from the Outside, and compels them to attack CT-41. As they are defeated they are drawn into Voronash. CT-41 can use the Lawgiver to deal heavy damage to Voronash, who when hit can be briefly seen as a skeletal apparition, similar in appearance to his Icon.</p>

				<p>As the fight drags on, Voronash begins to ooze throughout the chamber, filling in the room from the edges until, near his end, only a small area near the Prime Altar is passable. CT-41 fights an increasingly desperate battle in this constricted space, until Voronash finally decoheres, and all the Selves and extra-universal entities that he comprises are drawn into the Necrolith. The Necrolith now pulses erratically, and the Outsider within it speaks to CT-41.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"Even trapped within my Necrolith, the Devouring Spirit strains against me, Caretaker. He begins to consume the other strangers I hold captive within, and in but a little while he will break free of the bonds I have placed upon him. We must access my master Terminal, that I might effect certain changes upon this Altar."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 equips the Native Prosthetics, and moves to the Terminal. The Necrolith begins to glow, and rapid pulses of energy flow through CT-41's adopted limbs. The Altar itself begins to spark and sputter for several seconds, before going dark. After several tense moments the Altar blazes back to life and enters steady operation. The Outsider again addresses CT-41.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"It is time, Caretaker. We must go. Guide me to the Altar."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 climbs atop the Altar, an energy tunnel appears around it, vacuum generators remove atmosphere within the teleport channel, and CT-41 and his Companions disappear from Truth II.</p>

				<small>"A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness."</small>
