				<p>After defeating Ashteroth and receiving the God's Heart, CT-41 continues to seek out Lumen 2's secrets, and returns to the Quarry. With the many tools it has acquired, CT-41 leaps over enormous cut stones, swims through the deep waters that have accumulated, and defeats the rugged and enterprising creatures that have made the abandoned Quarry their home. CT-41 observes ancient carts and overhead cranes, exposed wiring, and rougher stone edges as it moves west. It finds and adapts the Mass Inhibitor, which it uses to push through a series of puzzles involving stacked stones. Eventually CT-41 reaches the western edge of the Quarry, and enters a narrow shaft bored straight west into the Laccolith.</p>

				<!--

					make them drink the water of gall

				-->

				<p>CT-41 follows this dimly lit shaft west, noticing the tubing running near the floor along the entire length of the tunnel as it goes. The bored tunnel and its tubing continue through several natural chmbers, and end only once CT-41 has moved far beyond the precious stone of the Laccolith. Here the tubes emptied their contents in ancient times, into several large pools. The pools of this Chemical Disposal Area are still heavily contaminated by corrosive liquids, similar to the ones CT-41 encountered in the Lower Ruins. Here, however, the toxins are much more concentrated, and rapidly deplete CT-41's shields and armor. Bubbles of corrosive liquids rise from some pools, and droplets and streams fall from the ceilings. Noxious fumes vent upward from the toxic pools, and the only creatures that live in them are hardy microbes, simple plants, and small shelled herbivores. The biosphere of the Chemical Disposal Area is dominated by creatures that cling to the ceilings.</p>

				<!--

				-->

				<p>After cautiously and boldly avoiding, wading or swimming through the Chemical Disposal Area, CT-41 finds a crudely carved and winding passageway meandering upward. CT-41 arrives at a fork, and first explores the western path. The tunnel leads to an extremely ancient and primitive shelter, in appearance similar to a Beast's nest but in structure similar to a Native habitation. As CT-41 moves through the habitation, the Outsider begins to reminisce.</p>

				<p>When CT-41 enters the main hall of the shelter, the Dark Room, the Outsider grants a Vision. CT-41 sees a crowd of young Proto-Natives of varying sizes, all huddled behind a larger Native. The ruthless and huge face of an Old God appears at the eastern edge of the chamber. This God's plating has an angular and bony aspect. After a long moment of hesitation, the Native flees through a rear exit. The Old God moves forward toward the young, and the Vision ends.</p>

				<p>CT-41 leaves the Dark Room and moves up and east, and again finds itself moving through pollution. Filthy brown and gray water seeps and flows down through this tunnel and its offshoots, but this dirty run-off does not deal damage. CT-41 opens up a blocked and hidden passageway into the Waste Chambers, one that the Explorers ostensibly used to carry particularly vile refuse down to the Chemical Disposal Area.</p>

				<p>Instead of moving back into the Explorers' Locus, CT-41 follows a passage up and west, into a region filled with dried sediments. CT-41 begins to see large bones and exo-skeletal segments protruding from the walls of this new area, and dislodges huge amounts of loose dirt and stone as it moves deeper into the Fossil Site. The petrified remains of Ancients that CT-41 encounters here are much larger than CT-41 has seen elsewhere in the Underground.</p>

				<p>CT-41 finds that there are still many living creatures in the Fossil Site, some buried and dormant, some holed up in their burrows, and others digging feverishly in pursuit of any prey producing seismic activity. CT-41 maneuvers around or through these creatures, and even uses them to help it burrow through otherwise impassable terrain.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Bones Round About Your Altars</div>

				<!--
				I will scatter your bones
				fill it with the choice bones
				they went to Baalpeor
				-->

				<p>CT-41 eventually excavates a path through the Fossil Site, and enters a a large tunnel, marked by enormous gouge marks on the walls. As CT-41 continues, it enters a section of caverns and tunnels whose walls are lined and decorated with bones. CT-41 notices the remains of several Proto-Natives among the ornamentation. Moving into the lower area of the Boneyard, CT-41 finds a tunnel filled with tightly packed bones and shells that it cannot pass, but continues its exploration of the upper region.</p>

				<p>At the end of its explorations CT-41 falls into a large open chamber. A fine white dust rises as CT-41 moves, and CT-41 finds strange effigies and platforms built from the remains of Ancients. At the center of the room is a dormant Old God, which CT-41 provokes to wakefulness. A light begins to shine within the monster, and it bursts out of its resinous shell.</p>

				<p>Baalpeor is a horned Old God, covered in bony protrusions and sharp claws. It is larger and less agile than Ashtoreth, more perfectly adapted to hunt other Ancients. CT-41 recognizes its face as the one it saw in the Vision of the Dark Room. Baalpeor attack CT-41 by charging at it, scattering and crushing its ceremonial bone heaps and effigies in the process. Baalpeor attempts to force CT-41 into a corner, where it will slam repeatedly into the much smaller robot.</p>

				<p>When CT-41 deals heavy damage to Baalpeor, its inner light will dim. Baalpeor slams itself against the ground, knocking CT-41 back and away from it. The Old God will then retract its limbs, and begin to sap CT-41's energy, pulling it into its Seed. Once CT-41's energy is drained completely, Baalpeor will resume its attacks.</p>

				<p>As CT-41 destroys Baalpeor's bony plating, it is able to deal high damage to the soft tissues underneath. When Baalpeor knows that it is beaten, it slams repeatedly against the ground in a dying rage, sending out massive shockwaves that knock CT-41 backward and shake the ground. Its death throes destroy the barrier of corpses that sealed its chamber shut.</p>

				<p>With Baalpeor dead, CT-41 moves to its dead husk, and takes it Seed. The Nanite Colony adapts it into CT-41's second God Item, the God's Hoard. With the Hoard equipped, CT-41 achieves its highest possible battery capacity, and slowly drains energy from any life forms or sources of electricity around it. The intensity of the light peeking through its paneling increases as the new battery fills.</p>

				<small>"They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead."</small>
