				<p>Once it has moved under the barrier, CT-41 continues moving east, and falls into the passageway leading down toward the Sanctuary. It returns to the staircase that led to the Sanctuary, and finds that the hole it blasted in the weakened stone has been repaired with heavy stone blocks that it cannot destroy or dislodge. It will be a long time before CT-41 returns to the Sanctuary.</p>

				<p>At the top of the stairway CT-41 finds an undecorated passageway leading east, that slopes gently into water. Without the Turbine CT-41 was unable to move into the tunnel, but it can now move through, and emerges onto dry ground at its far end. The cave is a dead end, but CT-41 notices some loose dirt on the ground, and uses the Resonater to disperse it. In the dirt CT-41 finds the PDR and Rank Card of Doctor Ines Orozco. From the PDR CT-41 reads a brief, primary account of Cobb's Mutiny, one that is much less sanitized than the lore taught in the Sanctuary.</p>

				<p>With Orozco's Lieutenant's Rank Card, CT-41 returns to the Farsight Colony and enters the Morgue. There it finds Kiaan Sood's PDR and Rank Card. CT-41 reads Sood's account of his investigation into Cobb, and learns more of the goings on in the Colony prior to Cobb's Mutiny. The Lieutenant Commander's Rank Card allows CT-41 to enter Sood and Kozlov's habitation units.</p>

				<p>Inside Sood's Habitation Unit CT-41 finds the Anti-Personnel Laser in a weapons locker. This green laser is as powerful as a fully optimized Thermal Laser, but with slightly higher energy requirements. If it wishes, CT-41 can now equip both of its lasers simultaneously, allowing it to deal high damage in short bursts.</p>

				<p>Kozlov's Habitation Unit is empty except for a data terminal next to his desk. The terminal diplays a message and a keypad, which CT-41 can read and interact with.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Terminal: <em>"Please enter your name: "</em></p>

				<p>Upon returning to the Colony, CICI informs CT-41 that UCA personnel sent several messages during the Turns of its explorations in the Underground. These messages detail several happenings in the larger sphere of human existence, and are seemingly unrelated to CT-41's journey. Some of these transmissions from the Colonial Administration will arrive at fixed dates, regardless of CT-41â€™s action or inaction.</p>

				<p>CT-41 independent transmissions</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">United Colonial Administration Transmission, #DATE: <em>"Due to the continued lack of reports, we cannot rule out the possibility of a hostile alien presence on Lumen 2, and the system will be quarantined. At such a time as communication from Lumen 2 resumes, we will be able to consider lifting the quarantine and sending relief. This is of course contingent on the circumstances under which communication resumes."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">United Colonial Administration Transmission, #DATE: <em>"Over the past 100 years the LIST array has been significantly upgraded, and we have cataloged millions of new and distant worlds. Among them are several that show the same patterns of destruction as the planets in the Lumen system. It is our working hypothesis that these planets were all attacked by the same alien force. The Administration has dispatched probes to many such worlds in an effort to study the remnants of life and technology on these worlds."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">United Colonial Administration Transmission, #DATE: <em>"Beginning approximately 2 billion years ago, many worlds in the Orion arm appear to have been scoured by beings we refer to as Destroyers. It appears that a world and its colonies were only targeted after its inhabitants began to expand beyond their home system. It is possible that the Destroyers only attacked interstellar civilizations, or that interstellar civilizations are most easily noticed."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">United Colonial Administration Transmission, #DATE: <em>"We have recently encountered alien vessels in the Orion arm. They are small, agile crafts, and do not appear to accelerate using ejected mass-energy. Our attempts to communicate have not been reciprocated. The vessels do not allow us to approach them, and retreat quickly when we attempt to close the distance with them."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">United Colonial Administration Transmission, #DATE: <em>"We are engaged in an ongoing conflict with the Destroyers. It is the consensus opinion of our anthropologists that, soon after Lumene Natives became interplanetary, they were discovered and attacked by Destroyers. Please attempt to make contact with any extant Natives: They may have technical information about the Destroyers that we lack.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">United Colonial Administration Transmission, #DATE: <em>"In the military interest of Earth and her many colonies, the Solar Navy and the Colonial Administration will soon be folded into a single organization. At such a time as this merger becomes effective, and per the terms of the Farsight Expeditionary Contract, the Farsight Colony and all its material and personnel assets will be acquired by the new organization."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 dependent transmissions</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">United Colonial Administration Transmission, #DATE: <em>"Hello CT-41. From the data you've sent, it seems apparent that some alien influence is responsible for Cobb's mutiny, and quarantine protocol will be enforced indefinitely. As such no relief vessels will be sent, but we are confident that you will continue in you mission of exploration, and will transmit your logs regularly."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 reads whatever transmissions CICI has received, but at the moment has no clear path forward. CT-41 has discovered the fate of the Farsight colonists, but cannot bring them back to the Colony, or even reenter the Sanctuary. The UCA has sent various transmissions, but has not provided any meaningful direction to CT-41. CT-41 decides that it will embark on its own explorations of Lumen 2. Armed with new weaponry and mobility tools, CT-41 decides to return to the deep places of Lumen 2, to seek out its fortune.</p>

				<p>For the next phase of its journey, CT-41 operates without guidance from human supervisors. Its path forward becomes less linear, and it is able to choose the order in which it confronts the Fragments of Thosmodeme, and discovers the Seeds of Native dead. It is in contrast with this newfound autonomy that later restrictions on CT-41's freedom will feel so jarring.</p>
