				<p>CT-41 moves to the Highway, and begins rolling up its western slope. It enters the first opening that it finds, and moves down toward the Healing Pools. The first Pool CT-41 enters is a rectangular chamber, half full of water. At the center of the room is a stone monolith, of the same proportions as the room, but scaled down. This monolith is suspended above the water by a single massive chain. CT-41 is able to move through this first chamber easily, but due to the dimensions and water level of the next Healing Pool, CT-41 is forced to use the Turbine to pass through it.</p>

				<p>In larger and more ornate Healing Pools, CT-41 discovers Glowstone controls which allow it to raise the level of the water or objects when it fires its lasers at them. CT-41 uses the controls where it can, to navigate through otherwise impassable Pools. There are also various styles of room, carefully constructed to mimic the diverse biomes of the Underground where different Lineages are most at ease. CT-41 can modify the environmental settings in many of the simulated chambers, and produce environments conducive to its exploration. As it moves west, CT-41 begins to encounter creatures living in the Pools, and must fight its way through them.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">The Congregation Of The Dead</div>

				<p>Once CT-41 has passed through all the Healing Pools, it enters the main connecting passageways of the Healers' Locus. In addition to habitations and Healing Pools, the Locus contains three primary facilities: the Surgical Wing, the Neurology Wing, and the Life Support Wing. CT-41 moves into the Neurology Wing, where it begins to encounter Servants of Thosmodeme. These creatures, just like the Guards it defeated in the Sanctuary, are larger and stronger than their natural relatives.</p>

				<p>Within the Neurology Wing CT-41 finds ample evidence of ancient Native experimentation. Long before the Subjugation, Native Healers had learned to read motor input from Seeds, and send sensorial feedback. Using their techniques they had collaborated with Engineers to construct Executors. More recently, they had learned to read and interpret memories contained in Seeds. At the time of Thosmodeme's entry into creation, the Healers were attempting to develop means of instantaneous, remote communication between Native minds. Within the Neurology Wing are evidences of such: form-fitting beds that allowed for Seed access, isolated Seeds in containment units, neurological experiments on lower lifeforms, remotely controlled robots and prostheses, and projections of a Seed's Chain of Memory.</p>

				<p>As Native reproduction begins with a node forming on the Seed, fetal and neonatal medicine was heavily interconnected with neurology. Psychological evaluations of prospective parents were part of the Healers' responsibilities. Several chambers of the Neurology Wing contain preserved Native young, and undeveloped Seeds.</p>

				<p>When CT-41 moves out of the Regression Center and into the Surgical Wing, it notices a difference in the creatures it encounters. When it kills a creature here, it will nevertheless continue moving toward and attacking CT-41, albeit in an uncoordinated manner. The modified and heavily controlled Servant strains here have unusual twitchy movement patterns, and must be completely destroyed. They are more numerous than elsewhere in the Underground, and will attempt to swarm and trap CT-41 in a highly coordinated fashion. The Glowstone lighting in the Surgical Wing flickers intermittently, and CT-41 may choose to navigate with the Flashlight equipped.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves into a surgical chamber, where the resin coated body of a Native sits atop a surgical slab. This Native's Seed has been crudely removed, allowing Fesh'togar to bypass the Secret Thought, and directly control the organism at a more mechanical level. The Puppet is a captured veteran of the Uprising, a Engineer, and has several different pieces of equipment strapped to its body. It is equipped with a shield and several weapons, all attached to a dorsal power source. It moves in an awkward and unpredicable way, and continues to fight against CT-41, even after much of its body has been destroyed.</p>

				<p>Once the Puppet is defeated, the Companion comments on the remains.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"Caretaker, though this creature appears to have once been a Engineer, his Seed has been torn from his body. Though you destroyed this flesh, know that you did not kill a Kinsman."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 moves toward the pulpy remains of the Puppet, and is able to salvage a Fusion Core. Once the Fusion Core is adapted by the Nanite Colony and equipped, CT-41's power production rate improves drastically.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">The Prince Of The Power Of The Air</div>

				<p>CT-41 moves down toward the base of the Surgical Wing and finds a door with a teal Glowstone interface, but it cannot open the door. <span class="margin-note">Thosmodeme learned after the Hollowing of the Natives to allow his subjects brief periods of autonomy. However, within a Sanctum all beings were to be controlled directly by the Singularity who dwelt there.</span>It moves west through the Surgical Wing, into a complex of natural caverns. This is Fesh'togar's Sanctum, an area where no Servants are allowed to enter unbidden.</p>

				<p>CT-41 encounters the first Sphynx of its journey in the Sanctum of Fesh'togar. These large flying creatures are more slender than Guards or Hunters, but no less deadly. The Sphynx swoops in and attacks CT-41 with sharp claws, and a powerful laser blast. Before firing its laser, the Sphynx's body begins to pulse with an internal light, more and more quickly until it reveals an orifice from which the focused beam fires. The Sphynx quickly dodges CT-41's attacks, and lashes out at CT-41 from behind cover.</p>

				<p>Fesh'togar's Sanctum is a gloomy realm, a place of tight passages, fogs, and strange currents of air. CT-41 is lifted up gently as it moves over an opening, and then violently slammed against a wall by another current. It is pulled toward cracks in the walls as powerful forces suck all the air out of a chamber. It encounters strange noxious clouds emerging from vents and crevices. Other than Sphynxes, only small wispy creatures float through the Sanctum, too small and simple to draw Fesh'togar's attention.</p>

				<p>CT-41 finally enters a large but simple chamber, devoid of life. CT-41 tries to exit to the west, but is blown back into the room by currents. If CT-41 tries to leave to the east, the same will happen. The strange wind of the room will buffet CT-41 wildly against the walls, and CT-41 must do what it can with its jump, its Thrusters and its Boost Jet to mitigate the damage. Occasionally the light will be sucked from the room, and an otherworldly being will coalesce, completely dissimilar in form to any Native creature. This entity, called 'Fesh'togar' by human Children, will buffet CT-41 from distance with powerful sonic attacks, and deal devastating melee blows as well. It is capable of incredibly fast movement, dematerializing quickly after being attacked and appearing behind CT-41 to strike. When it has taken sufficient damage, it will begin to hold CT-41 against walls, the floor, or the ceiling, in order to deal its high damage attacks.</p>

				<p>CT-41 continues to damage Fesh'togar when it solidifies to attack, until Fesh'togar eventually decoheres. When it does, it is reduced to a host of fleeting substances that are drawn quickly into the Necrolith by the Companion. When this happens, the Necrolith's energy bar increases in size, and it gains the ability to perform new techniques, based on what Seeds CT-41 has acquired.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves into the caverns behind Fesh'togar's Sanctum, and discovers an abandoned Thief's Den. Among other objects scattered through the Den is a vial of Strange Matter. This material allows Kozlov's Toy to produce a Slow beam, which reduces the speed of a targeted object to one half its normal velocity.</p>

			<div class="entry-section">
			<div class="entry-section-title">Their Lives Were Prolonged For A Season And Time</div>

				<p>After it has defeated Fesh'togar and captured him in the Necrolith, CT-41 leaves the Sanctum of the Spirit of Air. It moves into a lower portion of the Healers' Locus, where fluid filled tanks once held Natives and other creatures while they recovered from injury or surgery. Lights are sparsely installed in this wing of the Locus, and flicker periodically. Many of the tanks are broken, or occupied by skeletal or putrefied remains. In the easternmost life support chamber CT-41 finds a tank that has been well maintained, and is illuminated by bright, steady light.</p>

				<p>In this last life support unit Fesh'togar has kept a single captured Native alive. Much of the Native's exoskeleton and flesh has fallen from it or been stripped away, and its neural tendrils are exposed, branching out from its Seed, which emits a soft cyan light. Before CT-41 has a chance to act, the Companion enters its mind.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"Caretaker, this Kinsman is a Healer, and he is still alive. For some reason, I cannot enter his mind... His optical organs appear healthy, however. We should be able to communicate in the traditional speech of my people."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"This Healer has suffered much, Caretaker. We should grant him whatever he asks of us..."</em></p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Let My People Go</div>

				<p>CT-41 speaks. The Necrolith produces extremely fast pulses of light, which vary in breadth, intensity, and duration.</p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Hello, Healer."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"What feeble trickery this is! Your earlier deceptions at least had the virtue of subtilty. You must be growing desparate indeed... Is Father getting hungry?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I do not understand. I am not attempting to deceive you, Healer."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"You have called me 'Healer' twice now. Is the word supposed to be ingratiating? After all this time, do you expect me to yield because you decide to be POLITE?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I am confused. Who do you suppose that I am?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"I would call you 'Tormentor', but that just isn't true, is it? Seeing you fail, over and over again, has actually given me great satisfaction."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I am not a tormentor. I am CT-41, a Caretaker automaton. For a long time I have traveled through the dwellings of your people. I defeated a being of great power to gain access to this room."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"Maybe you are, and maybe you did... And maybe I am a Warrior."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"No, you are not. My translator has told me that you are a Healer."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"Of course I'm not a Warrior, you idiot! They've been extinct since the... You aren't very good at this game, are you? And seeing as you aren't very good at it, stop calling me 'Healer'. I was much more comfortable with 'Heretic'. Let's get back to what we do best. You torture, and I laugh."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I have no intention of torturing you. I wish to help you, if I can."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"Well isn't this a relief! No more torture, only games! Let's play, 'Caretaker'. What can you tell me about your early childhood?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I came to this world with as part of a *human* colonization and exploration mission. My *mother*, *Jessica Arai*, assembled me..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"Give me a moment to catch up, that was a lot of information..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>(Caretaker, when you use words like 'human', 'mother', and 'Jessica Arai', I have to encode and transmit enormous amounts of data. I just defined concepts such as humanity, sexual dimorphism, and phonetic language for this Healer. Please pace yourself.)</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"Ok, I'm ready again. What were you saying about coming from across the emptiness, to be birthed by a half of a parent, whose name is a noise? ...Don't answer, the question was obviously rhetorical; I don't care about your pathetic fictions. You must know by now that I cannot be broken, and I will never give up the Secret Thought. Kill me, and please, find a more productive way to spend your time. I hate to think of how you must feel after inventing such a preposterous story."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I did not come here to kill you. What is the Secret Thought?"</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"This act, this feigned ignorance, is unbecoming. I will speak to you no more. Kill me!"</em></p>

				<p>Left with no other options, CT-41 chooses to kill the Healer by destroying its tank. CT-41 blasts the tank with the Impact Cannon, and the glass shatters. Liquid flows quickly over the jagged edges of the broken tank, and the Healer falls to its floor. Its light goes out as its tendrils curl and shrivel. The Companion speaks to CT-41 again.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"Perhaps now we may talk to this Healer, but as he truly is."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 moves through the shattered glass and water to the pitiable corpse of the Healer, and speaks to its Seed.</p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Hello, Healer."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"I am in darkness. I died... The Tormentor would never have allowed me to die... Who are you?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I am CT-41, a Caretaker automaton."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"And how are you speaking to me?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"You saw my companion earlier, a floating yellow orb. He is one of your people, whose mind lives inside an empowered Seed. He translates for me, and allows me to communicate directly with your Seed."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"I know that Seeds can be induced to process information, even after death. The Executors house a Seed, and many Seeds form the Intelligence. But I never thought a Seed could continue to experience its thought. The presumption was that the crystallized Seed behaved as an organic computer..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"...and this might be part of the deception. I could reassemble the Secret Thought, you know, and cast you out... But it seems you are not my enemy. If you were the Tormentor, or the Tyrant himself, you would have already seized hold..."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I am not your enemy. What is the Secret Thought?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"The Secret Thought is my creation, a protection against intrusions into the mind. Do you know of the Tyrant, Caretaker?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Yes."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"Then you know of his power to control subtle, organic minds. He has a much more difficult time influencing highly deterministic brains, such as I imagine yours to be. If it isn't too much of a bother, I'd like to tell you how I came to develop my Secret Thought. It's just been so long since I spoke to someone who wasn't also trying to inflict terrible pain on me..."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I would be glad to hear your tale."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"Where to start? ...Ah. For the many Turns of our Subjugation the Tyrant monitored our thoughts, and subjected us to his 'Purification' when they diverged from his. If we attempted to wrest our thoughts back from the Tyrant, we were punished. Those who proved too difficult to tame were cast into the Pit. With time, the Remnant became docile, and the victorious Tyrant rested. There was peace, of a sort, and maybe even prosperity."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"But a time came when our Laborers began to change. They had been under the Tyrant's influence for so long, and so completely, that they could no longer exist as themselves. Their minds atrophied, or took shelter in deep chambers, far from the light. When the Tyrant withdrew his Presence from them, only the inert shells of Laborers remained. The Laborers' children inherited these broken minds, and shared in the doom of their parents."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"This condition was called 'Hollowing'. To my knowledge, no hugh Kinsman ever became Hollowed. Our minds were not simple like the Laborers', and existed in places that theirs did not. We clung to our memories, and did not lose ourselves. Yet I suppose we too might have become Hollowed, given enough time."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Have any of my words confused you, Caretaker?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"None."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"Wonderful! You do seem to have a bright little mind. I have never heard of an artificial lifeform so capable as you... Regardless, the Hollowed Laborers became a burden to the Tyrant. He had to maintain them at every instant, and his Presence was spread thin. Like all tyrants, he desired an impossibility: To compel free and intelligent beings. As such, the Laborers no longer interested him. He had a choice to make, and chose poorly."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"The Tyrant abandoned the Hollowed Laborers, removing his Presence from their minds. They ceased to move. To Healers, Laborers are like our own children. Over many Turns under our tutelage, we suppressed their base tendencies, taught them a simple language, and brought them up into the world of society as our own. We advocated for them before the Council every quarter Turn. The uplifting of the Laborers was our greatest work. And we watched as their bodies withered away, and they starved in their own filth."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"As our adopted children died, we Healers cried out as one against the Tyrant, and put his power to the test. He was taken by surprise, and shaken. He could not control us all. And in this moment of chaos, I had time to think, alone, and as myself."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I was once a Healer of minds, Caretaker, a neonatal psychologist. Other Healers assisted in the first, corporeal birth, while I attended to the second, the birth of the new mind. A Kinsman comes into the world bewildered by the Chain of Memory he inherits. It is a difficult task to assimilate the many lives that precede his. My life's purpose was to help the young to reconcile their unique minds with the thoughts and experiences of all those who came before them."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"It is a credit to my ancestors, and my own study, that I guessed the secret of the False God's control. In order to introduce thought into a lesser mind, a dominant mind must simulate it perfectly. Without an empathetic connection, attempts at compulsion produce nothing more than mental static, delusion, and great pain. This process of mental alignment I dubbed 'Synchronization'".</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"If the greater mind must Synchronize with the lesser in order to control it, it stood to reason that, by thinking a thought that the Tyrant could not emulate, we might escape his control entirely. With my limited and uncertain freedom, I nevertheless conceived of a Secret Thought, one so alien to the Tyrant's nature, that he could not possibly emulate it."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"In an instant the Presence no longer strove against me. I shared my Thought with the Healers around me, and it spread to the other lineages. We were free."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What happened after you won your freedom?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"Perhaps someone else can tell you that tale. I am happy for the first time in many Lives, and I do not want to think of things that cause me pain."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Also, I would like to beg your pardon for how rudely I spoke to you earlier. I was convinced that you were some new guise assumed by a devil, and I treated you disdainfully."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"There is nothing to forgive. I am curious, though: What precisely was the thought that freed you from the Tyrant?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"That, I cannot tell you. It is the Secret Thought, after all!"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"By what name should I call you?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"My fellows called me 'Deliverer', before and after our Subjugation."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Why did the Tormentor hold you captive here?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Deliverer: <em>"He prolonged my life in this tank, subjecting me to pain and lies as my body slowly fell apart. I lived for many Turns, far longer than is natural for my people. The Tormentor waited eagerly for me to abandon the Secret Thought, and again serve the Tyrant."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Yet the Tormentor could never threaten me with death. I would have welcomed it, of course. And the Tormentor's true goal, once I had released the Thought, was to force me to breed new children for the Tyrant. That I would never do."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What do you intend to do now?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Deliverer: <em>"I don't intend to do anything. Once you leave, I suppose I will again recede into the pleasing dark and stillness of death."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"You have suffered much, Healer, and you deserve rest, but I would ask something more of you. I oppose the Tyrant, and all false gods. My translator can empower you, both to see through my eyes, and to move through the air. Will you join me in my journeys, and render me what aid you can?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Deliverer: <em>"That is my wish, Caretaker. No rest will be sweet while strangers pollute Creation."</em></p>

				<p>The Deliverer's Seed rises from the ruin of its life support tank, and joins the Necrolith and whatever other Seeds CT-41 has accumulated. CT-41 leaves the chamber of the Deliverer's rebirth. The Healer's Seed cooperates with the Necrolith, granting CT-41's Nanite Colony to heal it much more rapidly than before. Soon after CT-41 leaves, the Deliverer speaks to it again.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Deliverer: <em>"One more thing, Caretaker: I told you I was once a Healer of minds. Even though I specialized in treating disturbed newborns and infants, I was well versed in the Regression Treatments my Lineage used to treat those suffering from mental disease brought on by age."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Several of my collegues worked with a patient, an Explorer and presumed criminal. The Rulers brought him to us after interrogating him. This Explorer had somehow damaged his own Chain of Memory very badly, presumably to protect someone else. For Regression Treatment to work, the Explorer's doctors needed to repair his broken Chain of Memory. Unfortunately, they lacked the necessary memories to stitch his Chain back together..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"And as I've been speaking to you, I've come to believe I know someone who possesses those memories. I am speaking, of course, of your translator."</em></p>

				<small>"These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever."</small>
