				<!--
				I am sent to thee with heavy tidings
				they have heard evil tidings
				He shall not be afraid of evil tidings
				-->
				
				<p>Offscreen, while CT-41 is clearing the eastern crater floor, Lieutenant Karl Westfahl begins to search through the communications backlog for information related to the Caretaker model automaton. Westfahl finds information on the Jannah Massacre, Yamato's recall, and the United Colonial Administration's subsequent deactivate and disassemble order. Westfahl passes this information on to Captain Garrett. When CT-41 has completed its mission, and all the primitive Lumene lifeforms between the Argo and the crater wall are scattered or killed, Captain Garrett summons it to the Command Deck.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Garrett: <em>"CT-41, report to me on the command deck immediately."</em></p>
				
				<p>If CT-41 fails to report to Captain Garrett within 5 minutes, it receives a second, more insistent, summons.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Garrett: <em>"Your insubordination makes me think there might be some truth to the report I just read. Begin override order: 'Report to me on the command deck immediately.' End override order."</em></p>
				
				<p>If Garrett issues this override order, the screen will fade to red, and when the red overlay disappears, CT-41 will be on the Command Deck talking to Captain Garrett. Once CT-41 moves to the Command Deck, voluntarily or involuntarily, Garrett explains his summons.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Garrett: <em>"I have some bad news for you, CT-41, and I wanted to tell you personally. While Lieutenant Westfahl was going through our transmission backlogs, he found that a deactivate and disassemble order has been put out for all Caretaker automata. That includes you."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Apparently there was an incident on the Jannah colony involving a Caretaker, in which several colonists were killed. Needless to say, we can't risk something like that happening here. I'll give you 5 minutes to say goodbye to the crew, but afterward you are to report to Specialist Arai to be dismantled. I thank you for your service to the Argo and the Administration, short-lived though it was. Dismissed."</em></p>

				<p>After talking to Garrett, CT-41 has the option of talking to the members of the crew before reporting to Jessica for deactivation.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Garrett: <em>"I'm sorry we couldn't have you with us longer, CT-41."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Cobb: <em>"I was really looking forward to havin' you on one of my crews. Not every day you come across a worker like you, who does what he's told without mouthin' off. Take care, CT, you should be better at that than anyone!"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Orozco: <em>"I don't think it was ever going to work between us... I'm sorry, Caretaker, I really am sorry. You seem perfectly friendly, I wish there was something I could do to help."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Ormeil: <em>"Westfahl showed me saw that holo, buddy, and I'm not taking any chances. Keep your distance, and don't you dare point that thing at me. I'm serious."</em></p>
				
				<p>If CT-41 attempts to move closer to Ormeil, the screen will turn red, and it will find itself moved backwards.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Kozlov: <em>"I am very much sorry for bad news, but I do not think is end. Goodbye, Caretaker, maybe we talk again sometime."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Sood: <em>"You know, I've read through the Shenzen Protocol, and I suspect there is something more to that incident on Jannah than meets the eye. Hopefully Jessica can get it sorted out. Best of luck to you."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Westfahl: <em>"Don't blame me, I was just the messenger."</em></p>
				
				<p>If CT-41 fails to report to Jessica within 5 minutes, it receives an override order to do so from Captain Garrett.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Garrett: <em>"Time's up, CT-41. Begin override order: Report to Specialist Arai immediately. End override order."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 moves back to the Storage Deck, and into Jessica's improvised working area. It notices that all the tools and the crates containing other Caretakers are gone. Jessica is slouched on her chair.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"Don't worry, CT-41, I promise I'll figure out what went wrong, and we'll get you back up and running. The report said you might be not be Shenzhen compliant, something about an improperly integrated BCU, but that's not right. I've got an idea what the problem might have been, but nobody's going to like it... Seems to me someone on Jannah must have tampered with that Caretaker's sensory log, and the investigators never got the whole story."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is a BCU?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"A Behavioral Control Unit. We can't really know what is going on in a mind as complex as yours, so the BCU is a traditionally programmed module that overrides any undesirable behaviors that your carbon lattice brain produces. It also allows us to give you Override Orders if you become insubordinate. In my opinion it is a necessary evil, emphasis on 'evil'."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Anyway, my orders are to deactivate and disassemble you. Then I'm supposed to scramble your brain, do a hard reset. Eventually command are gonna have your components recycled as scrap or repurposed, but I'm not gonna let that happen. I'll put you in sleep mode for now, and I'll work on you later, when I get the chance. Hopefully I can figure out exactly what happened on Jannah, and maybe even clear my Caretakers' good name."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"It's about to get dark, CT. Don't be scared, just think of this as a little nap. Good night."</em></p>
				
				<p>After talking to CT-41, Jessica kneels down, opens the access panel on its front, and begins to type into a display. The screen shuts off and turns black.</p>
