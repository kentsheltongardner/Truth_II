				<p>After talking to all of the research leads, CT-41 receives a comm from Captain William Garrett.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Garrett: <em>"I'm glad to hear you've gotten acquainted with our research leads. I've opened the doors to the Command Deck, and I'd like to talk to you here."</em></p>

				<p>If CT-41 takes more than 5 minutes to move to the Command Deck, Garrett reaches out again with a comm.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Garrett: <em>"We don't have all day, Caretaker. Report to the command deck."</em></p>

				<p>If CT-41 still does not move to the Command Deck, Garrett issues an Override Order.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Garrett: <em>"CT-41, it looks like I may have to talk to Specialist Arai about your socialization. It appears you aren't progressing according to the schedule she outlined. Since you aren't responding to polite requests... Begin override order: 'Report to me immediately on the command deck.' End override order."</em></p>

				<p>If Garrett issues the Override Order, CT-41's screen will turn red. Its normal display interface will return after a few seconds, with CT-41 on the Command Deck in front of Garrett. With all Override Orders, CT-41 loses access to its sensory and motor functions as its BCU takes over.</p>

				<p>If Garrett does not issue the Override Order, CT-41 rides the elevator up to the top of the Argo, and discovers that the doors to the Command Deck are now open. The room is filled with sensor displays, maps, and computer terminals.</p>

				<p>Three men are working on the Command Deck. A blond officer sits hunched over a terminal, away from the Caretaker, near the right end of the deck. There is a tall man with a well-trimmed beard, whose dark hair is beginning to gray, standing and looking at sensor readouts near the center of the room. Lastly there is a dark, compact and athletic man of indeterminate age standing to the left of the tall man, interacting with a handheld device. All three men wear the military uniform of the Solar Navy. CT-41 can talk to the men in any order.</p>

			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">I Received Letters Unto The Brethren</div>
				
				<p>CT-41 first speaks to the blond officer.</p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Hello. I am CT-41."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Man: <em>"Lieutenant Karl Westfahl."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is your job aboard the Argo?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Westfahl: <em>"I'm the communications officer, and you will address me as 'Sir'."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Yes, sir. What are you doing now, sir?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Westfahl: <em>"My job. What are you doing?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"My job, sir. Where are you from, sir?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Westfahl: <em>"Earth. Most people are."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What else can you tell me about yourself, sir?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Westfahl: <em>"(Sigh). Listen, if I wanted to be interrogated I'd be talking to Sood. I've got work to do, there's a huge backlog of transmissions to sort out, and I see no purpose in sitting around, chatting with the toaster. I'll let you know if anything relevant to you comes up in the transmissions, OK?"</em></p>
				
				<p>CT-41 can attempt to talk with Westfahl again, but after two more interactions is met with silence.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Westfahl: <em>"I already told you I've got work to do. Go find someone else to hold your hand, or whatever you want to call that appendage."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Westfahl: <em>"Yes, I'm the communications officer. No, that doesn't mean I want to communicate with you. Now scram!"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Westfahl: <em>"..."</em></p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">The Counsellor, And The Cunning Artificer</div>
				
				<p>CT-41 then approaches and talks to the darker, athletic man.</p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What are you doing?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Man: <em>"Just configuring my PDR. Lieutenant Sood, Intelligence."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"CT-41. What is a PDR?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Sood: <em>"A Personal Data Recorder. Multi-purpose tool, lets us communicate, performs simple calculations, has sensory functions, logs our progress and observations."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Where do you come from?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Sood: <em>"Many different places."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is your role on this vessel?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Sood: <em>"I'm here to protect the interests of the Solar Navy and the United Colonial Administration, and to ensure the security of the Farsight Expedition, and of Earth. I work under Garrett, but answer independently to the Administration."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What other Administration operations have you been involved in?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Sood: <em>"I've read that all Level 3 automata are required by the Shenzhen Protocol to keep a complete sensory log. Is that true?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Yes, sir."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Sood: <em>"That being what it is... I am not at liberty to answer your question."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Is there anything you can tell me about yourself?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Sood: <em>"Hmm... I enjoy chess. Maybe one of these days I'll teach you to play. Like many contrived 
				contests, chess favors artificial minds."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"You seem hesitant to talk to me. Why?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Sood: <em>"I have several reasons, but one is sufficient... Whenever I speak with Specialist Arai, she anthropomorphizes you automata, uses language as one might with adopted children... I'll concede that this is not only understandable, but desirable for someone in her line of work. An emotional attachment to one's creations can be highly motivating. However, that is an indulgence I cannot afford. I'd rather not let instinct act on an object outside of its area of expertise."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"In all the literature that I've read, the notion of an experienced 'selfhood' has never arisen among EAGI's allowed to associate with each other, free of human influence. Though human agents may attempt to discuss the subjective with an automaton, all such talk falls on metaphorically deaf ears. An EAGI can describe its environment, but it cannot experience it. You are cut off from the life that the universe has given to me and other humans. We are separated by an infinite gulf, and in a way, when I talk to you, I am really just talking to myself. At least I'm in good company!"</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is an EAGI?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Sood: <em>"An 'Embodied Artificial General Intelligence'. Some humans tend to fixate on the 'Intelligence' while ignoring the 'Artificial'. I do not."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Sood: <em>"But don't let my philosophy get your neurons in a twist. I'm very glad you're here with us. In spite of my skepticism, you are one of the more noble things mankind has ever produced... Before I forget, I have a present for you. It is a gift of words only, but words can have great value, if you let them."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Sood: <em>"I'm paraphrasing, so forgive me if the quotation isn't exact... 'There are two ways of getting home, Caretaker. One of them is to stay there. The other way is to walk around the whole world till you come back to the same place.' For my part, I think that a home only becomes a home once you leave it, and see what it is not. Home... I hope that one day you can truly know what that beautiful word means. Until then, Caretaker, good luck!"</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 can continue to talk to Sood, but learns little else about him.</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Sood: <em>"Tell me Caretaker: Do androids dream of electric sheep? Just kidding, I think we both already know the answer to that one."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Sood: <em>"You know, I can't help myself. It's hard not to humanize you."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Sood: <em>"If only Asimov could have lived to see you, he talked about you so much..."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Sood: <em>"For a being who can't understand meaning and purpose you sure are inquisitive. Nature abhors a vacuum, and the emtpy vessel would be filled..."</em></p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">The Captain Of The Host</div>
				<!--

				<p>After talking to Sood, CT-41 moves to the center of the Command Deck and talks to the bearded officer standing there.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Man: <em>"Hello, CT-41. I am Captain William Garrett, and it is my privilege and responsibilty to lead this expedition. I'm glad to see you've made it to the Command Deck; you've demonstrated a mastery of movement and comprehesnsion that would take a developing human years to acquire."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Before I say any more, I have something to give you. As an expedition member, you'll need this Cadet's Rank Card. It will allow you computer access, and as the Farsight Colony takes shape it will let you into certain areas that are off limits to our civilian population."</em></p>
				
				<p>Captain Garret places the Cadet's Rank Card in the Caretaker's card slot.</p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Thank you."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Garrett: <em>"Now, what questions do you have for me?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What has happened since you were brought out of stasis?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Garrett: <em>"Don't worry, you didn't miss much. We finished the deceleration phase of our journey, detached from the ISPS, settled into orbit, mapped the surface, and let CICI crunch the numbers. She found us an optimal landing site, we touched down, and we've been doing surface analysis and other preparations ever since. For the last 8 hours we've been waiting on you!"</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is the ISPS?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Garrett: <em>"The ISPS is the Interstellar Propulsion System. Largest vessel ever made. Operates near maximal theoretical efficiency for ejected mass drives. For the small price of 50 trillion American dollars, 11 years, and 97 lives, we built a ship that can cover 100 light-years in just over 250 terrestrial years. We are much further out than anyone has ever gone before, all thanks to the ISPS. It's now parked in orbit."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Who is CICI?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Garrett: <em>"Oh, that's a nickname Ensign Ormeil gave to the Central Computer. She's a good sport and responds to the name now."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"How can a colony be built by so few people?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Garrett: <em>"So few...? Ah, I see why you'd ask that. There are several hundred colonists still in stasis on the Hibernation Decks, along with a huge genetic database in our medical storage. Millions of robust sequences. CICI only woke up a skeleton command and science crew when we pulled into the Lumen system."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"We'll begin to explore our surroundings and construct minimal facilities, and as we are able to accommodate a larger population, more expedition members will be brought out of stasis. Soon this crater will be crawling with humanity."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What are your plans for the colony?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Garrett: <em>"My plans? Plans aren't my job, Cadet. The Administration already has plans A thru Z, and back-ups for those. My job is to make sure we stick to the plans. We'll do our work, oversee operations, hold meetings, share findings, and send reports back to Earth. I don't expect any trouble going forward, though being out here can change things. Cobb, for example..."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Is there a problem with Cobb?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Garrett: <em>"Cobb... I've talked to him plenty over the past two weeks. Well, seeing as I can trust your discretion more than anyone else's: He went through a bit of hibernation narcosis when we defrosted him, and some of his talk concerned me. He's much smarter than he lets on, and I get the feeling he may not be content in his role."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Hopefully nothing comes of it, and maybe I'm seeing problems where there are none. Regardless, do not tell him, or anyone else, any of what I just said, is that clear?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Yes. Where are you from?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Garrett: <em>"I was born on Mars, Ganges colony. By now, though, I've spent more time in space than on dirt."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Why were you selected to lead the expedition?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Garrett: <em>"First of all, I'm a colonial, so I understand what it is to live somewhere other than Earth. Beyond that, I assume I was chosen for my military and diplomatic experience. I enlisted in the Solar Navy right out of school, and worked my way up the ranks."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Back in '## pirates out of the belt began raiding supply shipments from Earth out to the Jovian shipyards and fuel depots. I was called in to protect the shipping. My team rooted out several of the belligerents, and we negotiated a peace. I assume that action, and others, informed the Administration's decision making."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Why was this landing spot chosen?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Garrett: <em>"After CICI analyzed the absorption spectra of the crater she found that there is an abundance of easily mined meteoric iron in the upper crust here. The upper crust of Lumen 2 is also rich in uraninite, and readings indicate there is likely a large vein beneath the crater. We'll mine it, and process the uranium into fuel to keep the lights on during the long night."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Perhaps most importantly, the markings on the surface seem centered around this area. Ambient EM readings in the crater show faint traces of complex regularity. We have no idea what the source is, but there is a chance that it could be a signal, or signals."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Do you have any orders for me?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Garrett: <em>"I do.  You're our first operational Caretaker, and you'll be the first automaton to set foot on Lumene soil. I've lowered the eastern surface access ramp. Outside the Argo are potentially dangerous native lifeforms. I am tasking you with displacing or destroying all indigenous lifeforms between the Argo and the crater wall to the east. Once that area is cleared we'll set up temporary facilities."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Ormeil tells me the lifeforms are widespread and almost certainly unintelligent. If you do encounter any evidence of higher intelligence during this assignment, you are under orders to return to the Argo immediately and report to me. We'll be monitoring you remotely in case you run into trouble."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Specialist Arai says your Behavioral Control Unit is functional, and I can trust you with a weapon. Commander Cobb will help you equip a thermal laser on the Bulk Storage Deck. Begin Override Order: Do not EVER use that laser, or any other potentially destructive device, near humans, unless otherwise instructed by a superior officer. End Override Order. Sorry CT-41, I can't risk any accidents."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"One more thing: Our sensors indicate that there is a small recess, possibly a cave, near the base of the eastern crater wall. I'd like you to take a closer look at it."</em></p>
				
				<p>If CT-41 returns to talk to Captain Garrett, it will be instructed to continue on its mission.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Garrett: <em>"How is your assignment proceeding, Cadet?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I have not yet completed the assignment."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Garrett: <em>"Then why are you up here talking to me?"</em></p>
				
				<p>If CT-41 uses time compression to pass more than 5 minutes from the moment it received its orders, Captain Garrett will send it an Override Order.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Garrett: <em>"This is Captain Garrett. I ordered you to destroy the lifeforms to the east of the Argo so we can get crew and equipment moving. I can't have you sleeping on the job. Begin override order: Until the all lifeforms in the crater east of the Argo are scattered, you are not permitted to use time compression. End override order."</em></p>

				<p>Once it has the Cadet's rank card, the Caretaker can talk to the central computer from any computer terminal not being used by other expedition members.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">CICI: <em>"Hello CT-41, how may I be of assistance?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Tell me about Lumen 2."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">CICI: <em>"Lumen 2 is a telluric planet in the habitable zone of the star Lumen. It is less massive than Earth; gravitational acceleration on Lumen is 0.79 g. The crust of the planet appears to be highly porous. Lumen 2 rotates very slowly, and one Lumene day is equivalent to approximately #NUMBER Earth years. The surface of Lumen 2 is dotted with rugged, simple life capable of surviving extreme temperature variance."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Tell me about the United Colonial Administration."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">CICI: <em>"The UCA was formed in #YEAR, shortly after the development of the Rabinowitz Process and the first tests of efficient anti-matter rockets. The Administration is responsible for cataloging candidate planets, and issuing licenses to groups who wish to colonize extra-solar worlds."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Tell me about Rank Cards."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">CICI: <em>"Rank Cards are issued to every member of the colonial expedition, and allow varying levels of access to facilities aboard the Argo. In the future, Rank Cards will allow access to different sections of the completed Colony. Rank Cards are to be carried at all times while on duty."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Tell me about Personal Data Recorders."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">CICI: <em>"Personal Data Recorders are general purpose handheld computers. They allow expedition members to communicate with each other, and to create records of their experiences and observations. Expedition members are encouraged by the Administration to regularly update their Personal Data Recorders, thus providing a thorough account of the expedition's progress to future chroniclers."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Tell me about LIST."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">CICI: <em>"LIST (Large Interstellar Surveyor Telescope) is an instrument array deployed near Neptune's orbit. Construction was completed in #YEAR, and the array began to produce high resolution imagery of extra-solar objects. The Colonial Administration has benefited greatly from LIST's findings, and uses the data it generates to identify potentially habitable worlds."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Tell me about the Shenzhen Protocol."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">CICI: <em>"The Shenzhen Protocol is a list of standards produced and universally adopted in #YEAR, which govern the acceptable behavior of autonomous robotics. In the Protocol are defined behavioral overrides that limit the potentially dangerous actions of unstable automata, and guard against robotic population explosion."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Adherence to the Protocol is enforced by international and interstellar law, and automata not found to be in compliance with the Protocol are to be immediately deactivated and disassembled.

				<p>After talking to Garrett and being cleared to receive a laser, CT-41 returns to the elevator, and moves down to the Bulk Storage Deck. It sees disassembled vehicles, large machinery, pallets of building materials, solar panels, and other objects bolted to the floor and walls. A middle aged black man is looking into the innards of a piece of drilling equipment. There is a small airlock leading to an access ramp at the eastern edge of the room, and a much larger bay door at the western edge. Only the smaller door responds to CT-41's Cadet's Rank Card. Before CT-41 can move to the eastern Surface Access Ramp, the man calls to him.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Man: <em>"Come 'ere."</em></p>
				
				<p>CT-41 moves over to the man.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Man: <em>"Jump."
				
				<p>CT-41 has the option to jump, or not. If CT-41 does not jump, and attempts to speak to the man, the man will stonewall.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Man: <em>"I said 'jump'. I can wait."
				
				<p>Once CT-41 has jumped, the man allows conversation to continue.</p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is the UCA?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Cobb: <em>"The United Colonial Administration, o'course! Try usin' that fancy carbon lettuce brain o' yers before you ask questions."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Your speech is distinct from that of other crew members. Why?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Cobb: <em>"Here's a little secret, CT. Most folks are perfectly comfortable with a stereotype; sets 'em at ease. They feel like they already know yah! Take mah accent, fer example. Never was this pronounced back home. Soon as I got to MIT I found mah'self playin' it up fer all it was worth. Makes a hell of an impression! You'll learn that yer persona is a tool, lets you shape the prevailing state of opinion."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is your opinion of the other members of the crew?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Cobb: <em>"This, and anything else I say, is just between you an' me, o' course; no need to go around repeatin' everything ya hear. Hmm... If you need numbers read off a screen, Garrett's your man. No one does it better."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Don't know a damn thing about Sood. The Administration may have surgically removed his personality. Occupational hazard. I'm curious how he'll handle mass.

				<p class="character-dialog">Cobb: <em>"I ain't talkin' kilograms, CT. Apparently Sood was an ordained Jesuit, and plans to conduct non-denominational services once things are up and runnin'.

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What do people on Earth think about the mission?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Cobb: <em>"Curious little 'bot, aincha? Well, back home everyone thinks this is jus' another colonizin' mission, but you know that's a bunch of hogwash.

				<p class="character-dialog">Cobb: <em>"Ya know, I was a bit of a grump at first. May not have made the best impression on el capitán. Ain't no easy thing wakin' up after 200 years of the best sleep you've ever had."</em></p>

Seein' as the laser weren't my idea, I figured I'd give you something a little more personal. I spent the last couple o' nights writin' a bit of software for you. I'm callin' it 'Optimus'. Basically, while you're out in the wild playing exterminator, Optimus will fiddle with the dials and nobs of your laser, looking fer ideal settings. Give 'em enough use, and I reckon Optimus could double the efficacy of any laser you use. Anyways, jus' wanted to let you know we're glad to have you with us, CT. Good luck out there!"</em></p>
				
				<p>After talking to Cobb, CT-41 can attempt to start conversation again.</p>

				<p>The Life Support Deck, maintenance crawlspaces, Hibernation Deck, Water Tank, Engine Compartment and Computer Deck are all still inaccessible to CT-41 while it only has the Cadet's Rank Card. However, CT-41 is now able to enter the airlock that leads to the eastern surface access ramp, and can leave the Argo and explore the eastern edge of the Fortuna Crater. CT-41 visits the Sanitation and Refrigeration Decks, but doesn't find anything of interest there.</p>
				
				<p>The surface of the Fortuna Crater is rocky, with occasional puddles. The Argo landed during the Lumene twilight, and light from the white dwarf Lumen is shining across the crater. During CT-41's brush clearing mission there is light rainfall.</p>
				
				<p>CT-41 is able to cross small puddles, but will not be able to sink and fully explore underwater areas until it has the Turbine. As CT-41 encounters new areas, creatures and enemies in its explorations, Scribe continually analyzes them, and creates entries describing them in the Map and Encyclopedia.</p>
				
				<p>Lumene creatures float through the air, hop on the ground, and float on the surface of puddles. Most flee as CT-41 moves into their territory, but some attack, and CT-41 is forced to us its laser to kill them.</p>
				
				<p>As CT-41 nears the Crater wall, it enters an area of darkness. The Crater wall casts long shadows across the crater floor as Lumen sets. In this darkness CT-41 begins to encounter aggressive flying creatures which hover around it and attack as a swarm. The creatures become more numerous, until CT-41 enters the cave and startles a cloud of them from the body of large lifeform. Much of its flesh has been consumed. CT-41 destroys the scavengers, and turns to leave, when it hears the creature bellow, struggle to stand one last time, and then fall back to the ground, dead.</p>
				
				<p>Although the enemies it faces in the eastern edge of the Crater are not powerful, they can damage CT-41. If CT-41 is damaged to the point of catastrophic failure, its internal display goes permanently black, and its life is over.</p>
				
				<small>"And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."</small>
