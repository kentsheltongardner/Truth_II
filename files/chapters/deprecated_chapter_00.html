				<p>All is darkness. A shimmering recollection coalesces over a few seconds. An aging and radiant Lumene Native walks onto a heavily modified Altar in a secret chamber. Soon after stepping on the Altar, the Native disappears. The flow of time reverses, and the Native can be seen in acting in reverse, removing the modifications to the Altar. When the Altar is completely cleared, the vision fades back to darkness.</p>

				<p>A new vision appears. The Native bows before an offscreen being of light, in a cavern where a strange fire burns. A host of Selves are drawn back into the Native's Seed, and it stands up. The vision fades to darkness.</p>

				<p>A new vision appears. The Native walks and flies backward down the Crags, as lighting flashes in the clouds and rain pours down. The vision fades to black.</p>

				<p>A new vision appears. The Native walks backward into a strange spacecraft at the center of the Fortuna Crater. The toppled and ruinous Argo can be seen to the east. The spaceship ascends as the dust beneath it quickly resettles. The vision fades to darkness.</p>

				<p>A new vision appears. The Native stands on the bridge of the Paralus, and a strange and powerful darkness radiates from its Seed. There is a sudden burst of light through the western view port, and the stars change. The vision fades.</p>

				<p>A new vision appears. The Native materializes suddenly in the Communications Bunker, gripping the broken and disabled CT-41. The Native backs away from CT-41, and several powerful attacks fly back toward its Seed. Armor paneling reattaches itself to CT-41, who becomes operational and rises from the ground. This vision also fades to darkness.</p>

				<p>A new vision appears. The Native hovers in the air above the blasted stone that seals the Pit of Voronash. The fragments of stone reassemble above the Pit of Voronash, and a blast of energy returns to the Native's Seed. The vision fades.</p>

				<p>A new vision appears. In the hidden Altar chamber, stalactites and stalagmites grow shorter and shorter, and the water level on the chamber floor rapidly oscilates. The rapid reversed flow of time stops abruptly as a Native emerges suddenly upon the Altar, stands, and observes its surroundings.</p>
