				<!--
				let them shut the doors, and bar them
				the doors of the parlour were locked
				And the doors shall be shut
				-->

				<p>Just ten minutes after escaping from Voronash, CT-41 receives an urgent comm from CICI.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">CICI: <em>"Caretaker, there is an unknown agent at work in the colony. It used a Commander's Rank Card to move through the facilities. It then transmitted an encrypted message to Earth from the Communications Bunker before destroying much of our interstellar communications equipment. Per protocol, I have placed the Colony in lockdown, and the intruder should be trapped inside the Communications Bunker. Please return to the colony immediately to investigate."</em></p>

				<p>When CT-41 draws closer to the Farsight Colony, it receives another comm from CICI.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">CICI: <em>"Caretaker, due to the emergency lockdown protocol, only a Captain's Rank Card will open colony doors. You may have to find an alternate route into the colony and to the Communications Bunker."</em></p>

				<p>If CT-41 attempts to compress time during this period, it will receive a message from CICI.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">CICI: <em>"Caretaker, please return to the Colony to investigate the recent intrusion."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 first tries to enter the Colony through the Garage and the Mine, but is blocked on both occasions by locked doors. It then tries to reach the Clifftop and perhaps move down into the Colony, but is unable to do so. It then uses one of the Altars in the Realm to move to the Excavation, but after entering the Excavation it finds the door to the Secure Wing closed and locked. CT-41 then attempts to move up into the Reactor, but lacks the tools to do so.</p>

				<p>As it moved through the Excavation, CT-41 noticed that there were pathways that it couldn't access. Having exhausted all other avenues of approach the Farsight Colony, CT-41 begins to think of how it might enter the Excavation from below.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">To Humble Thee, And To Prove Thee</div>
				
				<!--
				to humble thee, and to prove thee
				they shall come into the treasury
				Treasury door scans CT-41 to see if he can enter
				-->

				<p>If CT-41 has already satisfied the Challenger, it can move up into the Treasury and use the Corner Cutter to dislode the Barnacles that previously blocked its upward progress. Otherwise, CT-41 must enter the Arena and survive or destroy the Challenger in order to enter the Warriors' Treasury.</p>

				<p>CT-41 can enter the Arena from the east or from the west if it has the Linguist as a Companion. The Warriors' Locus contains a brutalist aesthetic of plain stone and rusted iron that is distinct from other Native Loci. The Arena itself is a large chamber, larger even than the Assembly Hall, with a dusty floor, and many simple doors leading to spartan habitations. It is dotted with elevated and hanging platforms that allow CT-41 to navigate through the room.</p>

				<p>Above and to the west of the Arena are the Holding Cells, and above and to the east is a locked door. Above the door is a laser scanner, which quickly sweeps over CT-41 and denies him access.</p>

				<p>At the center of the Arena floor is a large, motionless mechanical device. If CT-41 shoots the device with any of its weapons, the device begins to power up, and search the dim Arena with several spotlights. The device initially acts as a turret, firing lasers and tracking projectiles at CT-41. CT-41 must dodge the projectiles, while attacking the Challenger when it fires.</p>

				<p>When CT-41 deals sufficient damage to this first form, the Challenger raises up from the ground, exposing a treaded base. It begins to move across the Arena floor, seeking ideal firing positions from which to fire at CT-41, and dealing massive damage and knockback if it rams into its foe.</p>

				<p>When CT-41 again deals sufficient damage, the Challenger begins to hum as its anti-gravity unit powers up. The Challenger now hunts CT-41 down wherever it hides. In this form the Challenger begins to use an omnidirectional pulse to attack CT-41, who must find cover to avoid its damage.</p>

				<p>If CT-41 survives for a pre-determined amount of time against this final form, the Challenger will return to the center of the Arena, and hunker back down into its unpowered state. If CT-41 is able to destroy the Challenger, it takes the Native Alloy from the wreckage, which the Nanite Colony uses to produce the Alloy Shell.</p>

				<p>Regardless of how it bests the Challenger, the side doors to the Arena will unlock, and the scanner at the top-east corner of the room will now allow CT-41 to pass through the door it activates. CT-41 enters, and passes through a hallway lined with statues of ancient Warrior champions and leaders. At the end of the hallway CT-41 finds the Treasury, a series of caverns where the Warriors hoarded their wealth and trophies. Within are caverns full of precious stones, preserved monsters from the surface and the Underground, ancient stone tablets and other relics, and three separate vaults containing valuable Materials.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">As Infants Which Never Saw Light</div>

				<p>CT-41 takes what it can from the Treasury, and notices a drip falling from the ceiling of one of the older chambers. It moves up through a fissure in the ceiling, and uses the Corner Cutter to destroy several Barnacles that have grown in the passage. Eventually CT-41 enters the base of the Upper Ruins, and moves west through the long abandoned chambers. CT-41 finds no evidence of high technology here, but does find stones and pieces of animals fashioned into crude tools.</p>

				<p>At the western end of the Ruins CT-41 finds a winding passageway leading down to several pristine and clear pools. On the side of the chamber are Glowstone tapestries of Lumen, Nox and numberless stars. There are effigies of Natives and animals from the surface, and the Fortuna Crater and the Volcano. As CT-41 lights the chamber these tracings begin to shine. Their brightness is dependent on the proximity and intensity of the light CT-41 produces. As CT-41 moves through the pools, the Outsider grants it a vision of a small Native playing.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves up and west out of the Nursery, and enters the Farsight Colony's Liquid Waste Tanks. CT-41 is unable to move into the Colony through the piping leading to the Garage, but can move up the ragged borehole that leads to the grating in the Washroom. CT-41 blasts the grating away with the Impact Cannon, or melts it with the Resonator, and enters the Farsight Colony.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">The Stranger That Is In Thy Gates</div>

				<p>The Farsight Colony is dark except for the dully flashing emergency lights. CT-41 summons the still active Surface Access Elevator to the Washroom, and moves up toward the Communications Bunker. Like all other doors in the Colony, this one is locked.</p>

				<p>Undiscouraged, CT-41 moves into the unfinished Rec Center, and steps onto the scaffolding at the western end. Using the Resonator it destroys a vent cover, and moves up into the Colony's HVAC ductwork. CT-41 finds one passage that leads to the Crater wall, and another that goes up toward the Communications Bunker. CT-41 moves up and then east, before falling unceremoniously into the Bunker.</p>

				<p>Patiently waiting in the Communications Bunker is a Native, very similar in appearance to the dead Outsider CT-41 saw in the Ancestral Halls. The Bunker itself has been torn apart; monitors and projectors are smashed and flickering and everywhere wiring is exposed and torn. CT-41 moves to question the intruder.</p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Who are you? What are you doing here?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Intruder: <em>"CICI tells me you are a 'Caretaker'. My Master told me you would make it here eventually. Tell me: Where did you find your strange glowing companion?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Among the ancient Shrines of your people."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Intruder: <em>"And did someone... give it to you?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Yes, it was given to me, by a dead member of your race."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Intruder: <em>"Curious... I'm not sure I believe you, but I'll pull the truth out of you, one way or another."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I have told you the truth. I cannot lie. But you have avoided my questions: Who are you? What are you doing here?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"You may call me 'Outsider', and I am here on my Master's errand. He has seen a vision, and uttered words of prophecy, and command. He sends a message to you, of gratitude."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Why would he thank me?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"For freeing him, of course! Though my Master is a being of great wisdom and power, the Tyrant long held him cruelly bound. Then you arrive with your makers, as my Master foretold..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Long I have watched you from afar, as you moved through the Realm. While you battled the Tyrant, as his vigilance lessened and his power waned, my Master was able to escape his prison and claim his stolen birthright. You have hastened the day of his ascension."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Why have you entered the colony and damaged its facilities?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"As I said before, you stupid contraption, I am here on my Master's errand. I will spare you the details, but before a Turn passes, the fruits of my labor will ripen."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Who is your Master?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"My Master is yours also, though you are an unwitting and unwilling servant."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"How did you enter the colony?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"I entered by the front door, courtesy of one 'Otis Cobb'."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I cannot allow you to leave."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"Fool! I could leave at any time, were that my desire, and you could do nothing to stop me! But I have no intention of leaving yet. I still need you! I will take you apart, and study you, piece by piece. I'll learn your secrets, and discover how, and from whom, an abomination such as yourself stole that Necrolith. Now defend yourself!"</em></p>

				<p>The Outsider attacks CT-41, and during their battle deals heavy damage using powerful Native weaponry. Midway through the battle, as he becomes wearied, the Outsider begins to use strange powers to attack CT-41. CT-41's Outsider intervenes, and shields CT-41 from these attacks with uncanny precision.</p>

				<p>Eventually, and in spite of the Outsider's abilities and equipment, he is bested by CT-41. When he is knocked down by CT-41's final attack, he drops an item to the ground. The Outsider again speaks to CT-41.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"You are in luck, Caretaker. It appears your ally knows me all too well. No matter, I have already achieved my purpose. Farewell!"</em></p>

				<p>The Outsider uses his Necrolith to open a Tear, and flees to the Prime Altar, where CT-41 cannot follow. With the Outsider gone, CICI brings the Colony out of lockdown. CT-41 retrieves the item dropped by the Outsider, and discovers that it is a Commander's Rank Card. With the new Rank Card, CT-41 is able to enter the Refinery, where it finds and equips the Pneumatic Pistons. It also gains access to Otis Cobb's quarters, where it collects his PDR.</p>
