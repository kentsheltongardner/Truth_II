				<p>CT-41 moves up and eastward, out of the Oasis, and finds an excavated tunnel that leads to the side of the Destroyer Wreck. The tunnel turns abruptly upward, following the twisted wreckage upward along the hull. After following the hull upward for several meters, the tunnel bifurcates, and leads toward a base of operations to the west and a door cut into the Wreck to the east. The base has been excavated out of the crushed rock and sand of the area, and is supported by strong yet lightweight adjustable metal rods and baseplates. CT-41 notices several specimen jars in which Explorers stored interesting pieces of Destroyer technology.</p>

				<p>After taking what Materials it finds in the Explorers' base of operations, CT-41 moves into the crudely cut opening im the outer hull of the Destroyer Wreck. Unlike the area of the Wreck explored by Farsight expeditionaries, the region that CT-41 moves into is expansive and open. Many adjacent compartments and spaces lead to each other, not by design, but due to damage to the Wreck itself.</p>

				<p>CT-41 observes several ways in which this new area differs from all others it has encountered so far. The Destroyer Wreck is tilted at an angle, and almost all of the surfaces here are slanted toward the west. Additionally, the Destroyer construction style is much more compact and claustrophobic than either human or Native regions. Destroyers do not build their operating spaces as living areas, and comfort and aesthetics are not considerations.</p>

				<p>The Gateway section that crashed to the surface of Lumen 2 has more in common with an organism than it does with human or Native machinery. The many constructs that CT-41 encounters in the Wreck are fully integrated into the structure of the crashed Gateway, and blend seamlessly into its contours. The Destroyer Gateway builds and repairs itself by drawing elements from the many living fluids the run through it. Even in its ruined state, many of these fluid channels are still operational, and CT-41 sees flows of various colors and consistencies running through the superstructure of the vessel.</p>

				<p>Many of the flowlines have been damaged, forming pools of strange chemicals that fill entire compartments. These pools, spouts and drips affect CT-41 and Destroyer constructs in various ways as they pass through them. Many of the enclosed spaces of the Wreck also contain unique atmospheres, designed specifically for those chambers, or resulting from leaking pipes.</p>

				<p>CT-41 finds several local Gateways as it moves through the Destroyer Wreck, allowing it to jump great distances across the vessel. Most importantly it finds a Hub, a room containing many Gateways, that during its active operation allowed for efficient movement by contructs attending to the Gateway. Many of the local Gateways in the Hub are inoperable, as they are paired to Gateways that no longer function. In three rooms it explores, CT-41 finds the inverted silohuettes of Natives etched on walls in front of which they were ostensibly vaporized.</p>

				<p>After passing through a maze of many local Gateways, and defeating many novel Destroyer constructs, CT-41 arrives at a large chamber containing a single enormous Gateway connected to the Orion Stellar Harvester. This Gateway opens downward from at the top of the chamber, but does not activate for CT-41. Shortly after entering the chamber, and after several seconds spent activating, a large and unique Destroyer construct called a Torchbearer falls through the interstellar passageway.

				<p>The Torchbearer is the most powerful Destroyer enemy CT-41 fights during its journey. Like all mobile Destroyer constructs its movements seem unnaturally quick, especially given its large size. The Torchbearer wields a Coronal Aperture, which opens a Gateway to a distant star, and blasts stellar radiation and plasma directly at CT-41.</p> 

				<p>CT-41 must be incredibly nimble and precise in its movements to defeat the Torchbearer, and once it has dealt sufficient damage, the Torchbearer falls apart. CT-41 moves forward to inspect the wreckage, and takes the Torchbearer's Coronal Aperture. After the Nanite Colony adapts the weapon for compatibility, CT-41 equips the Coronal Aperture, and discovers that, like the Volatility Launcher, it does not require energy to operate. CT-41 investigates that Gateway at the top of the chamber, but it does not reopen.</p>

				<small>Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.</small>
