				<p>After descending the Mountainside, CT-41 returns to several areas of the Underground, and finds them changed. The plentiful animal life that once filled the Womb, the Sea, the Farmland and the Frontier is all gone. No trace remains of the many creatures, hostile and friendly, that once populated these vital regions. CT-41 is able to move through these areas more quickly now, but is disturbed by the unnatural quiet.</p>

				<p>CT-41 notices that this mass extinction centers around the Uraninite Vein, and is intrigued by the dark hole near the center of its Map of the Underground. CT-41 recalls a conspicuous opening it once saw above the Sea, but was unable to explore when it first crossed. Using the Tunneler CT-41 reaches a ledge near the top of the enormous cavern that holds the Sea. CT-41 moves into a passage that leads eastward, over and across the Sea. While avoiding waterfalls that would carry it down into the Sea below, CT-41 eventually reaches the Uraninite Vein.</p>
				
				<p>The Uraninite Vein is not solid, and many passageways weave through it. In these passages CT-41 finds vegetable life that saps energy from the radioactive decay of the surrounding rock. Uraninite Leeches and other slow moving creatures crawl through the dark, and CT-41 finds and defeats several living Uraninite Lords hidden in pockets throughout the Vein. After defeating each of these Lords, CT-41 takes the Actinides that it drops.</p>

				<p>Halfway through the Vein, CT-41 discovers a passageway leading up and out of the Vein. Partway up the passageway CT-41 finds the first of several strange Idols. These large statues of Natives are a lustrous black, and serve as gatekeepers for Voronash and his Angels. If CT-41 attempts to move past the Idol, the Idol's many eyes will light up, and it will hurl CT-41 away with violence.</p>

				<p>At the bottom eastern end of the Vein, CT-41 finds the dead remains of several Uraninite Lords, and eventually comes to a strange stone wall. The wall appears to be made of natural rock, but it shimmers, blurs and flickers in and out of existence. CT-41 cannot use the Tunneler or the Impact Cannon to move past or destroy the strange barrier, and is momentarily confounded.</p>

				<p>CT-41 then remembers the strange tool that Vadim gave to it in his Hermit's Cave. Although CT-41 has tried many times to use the Lawgiver in combat and exploration, until now the weapon has produced no discernible effect. Its powerful particulate blasts have dissipated into thin air on contact with all natural targets. Intrigued by the otherworldly wall in front of it, CT-41 equips the Lawgiver, and fires. The rockface disappears, and CT-41 sees a momentarily stunned Native behind it.</p>

				<p>This Native is the first Angel CT-41 encounters in its journey. It resembles the Outsider CT-41 faced in the Communications Bunker, but its coloration is white rather than yellow. CT-41 moves forward into the newly opened cavity, and is greeted by the Native.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Firstborn: <em>"I am the Firstborn, and the Chronicler of my people. Well I remember you, for my Father once faced you in battle. Though you escaped fate in that contest, my Father has since grown powerful. Be warned, Caretaker: I am heir to a portion of his newfound strength. Come no further, or I will destroy you!"</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 can choose to leave, but instead attempts to move past the Angel. The Firstborn lashes out at CT-41, and pummels it with the same apparently magical attacks that the Outsider employed in the Communications Bunker. Each time the Firstborn wields his powers, his Seed can be seen blazing within him as tendrils of strange energy course through his body. CT-41 tests out the Lawgiver against this foe, and notices that the weapon deals devastating damage, and has a strange effect on the Native. Whenever CT-41 hits the Firstborn with the Lawgiver, the strange light in his Seed is darkened, and his powers are temporarily disabled.</p>

				<p>CT-41 pushes the Firstborn back through the tunnel it defends, and eventually strikes a killing blow. The mortally wounded Firstborn falls to the ground, and begins to pulsate. When he finally dies, his Seed fractures, and many natural Selves flee from their prison. The Outsider lets these Selves depart Creation, but does capture a number of entities from the Outside. CT-41's maximum available Necrolith energy increases.</p>

				<p>After moving past the Firstborn, CT-41 enters his home, a beautiful cavity painstakingly carved into the dark rock. A strange glistening fluid fills the Chronicler's pool, and strewn about the home, stacked high on the floor and walls, are stone tablets inlaid with thin Glowstone writing. Chisels, grinders, and various small Seeds and animal fluids line the workspace.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves out of the Chronicler's home and forward into a new region, called the Suicide Passage. This pathway, lined with hard, unyielding stone, is an old passageway, only rarely frequented by Voronash's Angels. It is the home to large stationary creatures called Death Breeders, and their bastard children, most of whom never inherit their life.</p>

				<p>Death Breeders are stony colonies whose roots reach all the way to the Uraninite Vein, and from which several different strains of Death Spawn emerge. Death Spores leave their Breeder and take root in the ground. If any other creature touches them before they are fully grown, they detonate violently. Death Creepers move along the ground, detonating on contact with any foreign life. Death Floaters hang in the air, exploding if any other lifeform touches them. Death Seekers move through the air, throwing themselves at any foreign creatures they see.</p>

				<p>CT-41 braves the Suicide Passage, ever wary of the position of the various Death Spawn that haunt its chambers and corridors. These creatures deal massive damage to CT-41 if it touches them, and launch it through the air, possibly towards even greater danger. CT-41 moves continually upward, destroying adult Death Breeders wherever it finds them.</p>

				<p>After a cautious and daring traversal, CT-41 emerges from the Suicide Passage just as the Outsider did long ago. CT-41 moves west, and at last, at the heart of the Underground, enter's Voronash's domain.</p>
