				<div class="entry-section-title">Into The Guard Chamber</div>

				<p>When CT-41 reaches the western shore of the Sea, it rolls up out of the water, dripping for a few seconds after leaving. It enters a generic Native door atop a pier, and enters a tunnel lined with decorative stone. The tunnel connects the Sea to the Openings. These are large elevator shafts that were once used to move bulk material from the Underground to the surface, and vice versa. CT-41 enters the eastern Opening, and lets itself fall down the shaft. At the moment CT-41 is incapable of climbing up the smooth wall of the Opening, and no lift is in site. CT-41 continues west, and exits the Openings at their base, onto the western half of the Highway.</p>

				<p>CT-41 rolls quickly west, past several impassable doors and tunnels, and finally past an ornate staircase made of beautiful carved stone. CT-41 continues further west and enters the Quarry. The stone here is the same as CT-41 has seen on the ornamental staircase and elsewhere throughout the Realm. CT-41 sees pulverizing and cutting machinery, large chemical drums and enormous stone sections, but is as of yet unable to move far past the Quarry's entrance.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves back to the beautiful stair, and begins to climb. The path at the top leads east into an ornate chamber, with a corroded bronze statue in the form of a Lumene Native at the center of the room. There is a beautifully framed door at the far side of the chamber, and CT-41 moves toward it, but it does not open. CT-41 may attempt to fire a weapon in the chamber. When it does, lights appear on the statue, and CT-41 hears high pitched sound as its reactor comes online.</p>

				<p>The statue is rickety and ancient Native Executor. While its armor is rusted, and its movements are plodding, it is nevertheless a formidable foe for CT-41. Its heavy armor is capable of absorbing enormous punishment, and it can deal high damage to CT-41 with its lasers and heavy melee strikes. CT-41 eventually defeats the Bronze Executor, which begins to flash more and more rapidly. Eventually the Executor self-destructs, producing a massive shockwave that blasts CT-41 backward and deals high but non-lethal damage. The detonation blows open both doors to its guard chamber.</p>

				<p>CT-41 enters the Ancestral Halls. Every wall here is stone, there are no doors, lighting, wiring or technology, and not a single Lumene lifeform is present. CT-41 pulls out its Flashlight to see in the pitch black darkness, and discovers a huge stone statue of a primitive Lumene Native towering above the center of the first chamber. The statue of the Common Ancestor casts long shadows across the room. Carved in bas-relief into the walls behind the statue are scenes of the Womb, and flowing lines leading to chambers above, to the right, and below. These secondary chambers contain statues of the Philosopher, the Nurturer, and the Adventurer, which in turn lead to tertiary chambers containing statues of the six Native Lineages.</p>

				<p>In the Healer's shrine, the Healer tends to a dying Farmer. The Warrior, flanked by two of its Hunters, faces a Beast. The Engineer ponders a Glowstone. The Ruler speaks to a crowd composed of various Lineages. The Farmer sits contentedly among the Root Fields. The Explorer stands atop a peak, looking out and upward.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Companion In Labor, And Fellowsoldier</div>

				<p>In the Explorer's shrine, CT-41 finds a statue that has been horribly defaced, and which is barely recognizable as a Native. Cradled on the broken statue is the much smaller shell of a Native Explorer. There is a tool on the floor in front of the statue, and CT-41 moves forward to grab it. Before it reaches the tool, the Native's white Seed flickers to life within in, and a voice appears in CT-41's mind. This voice's words do not appear in the normal text box at the bottom of the screen, and instead materialize at the top of the screen in a box with rounded edges.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Native corpse: <em>"Hello, Caretaker. I knew you would find me here."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What are you?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Native corpse: <em>"I was your enemy, but I am your friend. I killed you, but I will do what I can to save your life."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I am having difficulty processing those data."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Native corpse: <em>"There are no contradictions. Are you not ruled by logic?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"You say you killed me, but I am alive?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Native corpse: <em>"Yes."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Native corpse: <em>"... ..."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"How are you talking to me?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Native corpse: <em>"I kept you for many Turns as a trophy in my home. A time came when I took you down off your mounting. I analyzed your storage, and the fragments of your 'carbon lattice brain', and learned how I might speak directly to your mind. Your language is a simple one, a product of the limited human organism."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is this place?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Native corpse: <em>"We are hidden beneath the Shrine of my Progenitor, the Explorer. I came here to die, and then to meet you."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"How did you know I would come here?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Native corpse: <em>"Little Caretaker, I once broke you in combat. You were a mighty warrior then, the lone Champion of your human creators. You very nearly defeated me, but I was still your better. When the time was right, I took you apart, studied you, and learned your secrets. Your memories told me that you came to these Ancestral Halls once, and found a crude but essential weapon. Now you also find my rotting shell, and my Self."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Can you prove that what you say is true?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Native corpse: <em>"Your creator, Jessica Arai, grieved the loss of her children."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"...Why were you my enemy?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Native corpse: <em>"You opposed my former master."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Who was your master?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Native corpse: <em>"My master... I suppose I should no longer call him such, but habit has such terrible power... He is a giver of great gifts."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I am confused. I do not have sufficient data to contextualize your statements."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Native corpse: <em>"Forgive me, Caretaker. You are not the same creature I once knew, and there is much you do not yet know. What can I tell you?</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What should I call you?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Native corpse: <em>"I hadn't thought of that... Give me a moment to search your language... Ah! I will be your Companion, and you may call me such."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Tell me about yourself, Companion."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"As far as I know, I am the last of the Remnant of my people. My body was born after the Destruction, into the Lineage of disgraced Explorers."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What was the Destruction?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"My people were born in the Womb of this world, beneath the great Sea. Long we were content in our deep homes, until Explorers dared to venture into the emptiness above. Others followed, and we built false caves for them on the surface of our planet. We sought out the other worlds bound to our star, and dared to look further..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"But as looked, we were also seen. Dark vessels descended on our colonies, destroying them utterly with blinding light. On this world a Remnant of my people was saved by a great Sacrifice. We fled into the deepest of our ancestral caverns. The dark fleet scoured the surface of our world, and we cowered as the roar of the Destruction echoed down from the chambers above. When it had passed, we began to rebuild our ancient home, and preserve what we could of our knowledge. My Lineage, the Explorers, were burdened with a great Punishment."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"You say that a Remnant of your people survived, but I have not seen them. Where are they?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"That is a long story indeed... I cannot tell it in full, but I will relate my part in the tale."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I was born in violation of the Rulers' decree. My parent was never given the Right of Continuation. I was hidden as a child, and I grew in darkness. Yet my thirst for knowledge was fierce. When I was grown, the Remnant gained much from my investigations into nature. I examined the smallest building blocks of creation, tearing them apart to discover what secrets they held, and my fame became great."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"But the shame of my birth became known. I fled to a place one of my ancestors had braved, far back on the Chain. There I made my home, my Laboratory. In solitude I pondered nature's mysteries, and stumbled upon a truth that damned my hopes of a perfect knowledge."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I proved, to a certainty, my two Existential Dilemmata, which may be understood as different expressions of the same truth. First, no finite universe can be fully explained or understood without an enclosing system. There will always be external causes without which such a universe cannot exist. Second, no infinite universe may admit of a finite description. Some new and necessary axiom must always arise to reconcile those that preceded it."</em></p>

				<p>"If Creation is finite, there are realities beyond it. And if Creation is infinite, it can never be fully understood, much less explored. The Lineages of my birth and my tutelage both raged against these truths, but could not deny them. I will never enter the final cavern. I was left in a depression which lasted a quarter Turn."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Then a dark thought took me. I might not be able to have all knowledge, but if I could look upon Creation from the Outside, I might at least understand its nature fully. I built an Altar. In service of my dark thought I weakened the walls of Creation, until they tore. Through that Tear I hoped to catch a glimpse of sacred knowledge."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"But the Outside was not a place I could comprehend. I dared not venture beyond my ability to return."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What was the thought that inspired your work?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"When a living thing dies, it is less than what it was, though every particle, every iota of mass and energy, is accounted for. Something leaves our world... But I am told not to dwell on that thought any longer."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"In spite of my failure to comprehend the Outside, I saw that my Altar had great value. In tandem with other Altars, it allowed for extreme swiftness of movement. Once I perfected my first Altar, I constructed seven more throughout the Underground, in caverns known only to the Explorers of old. When the time was right, I sent a message to the Rulers of the Remnant. I told them of my Altars, revealed their locations, and explained the manner of their use. The Prime Altar only I kept for myself, so that none else might enter my Laboratory.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"All the Kindred were astonished and delighted. Though the Engineers analyzed and dissected my Altars, not with all their tools and learning could they divine their secrets."</p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"The Rulers asked that I return to dwell with the Remnant. I did, and was received with honor. The sin of my birth was pardoned. The Explorers' Punishment was no longer mine to bear, for I was a to be called 'Explorer' no longer. I was chosen to be a Progenitor, the first to be so named in his own time. The Rulers granted me the Right of Continuation, that I might be father to a Lineage of Magicians. When the time was right, I was to make the Warriors' Sanctified Locus my abode."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"But this was never to be. Soon after the Remnant began to use my Altars, something entered from the Outside. It was unlike other beings, its substance was strange. It came to the minds of our Laborers as one of the Old Gods, finally returned. They were enraptured by its Presence."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"When the Tyrant was ready, he revealed himself to the High Lineages also, and took my people swiftly. When I first sensed the Presence in my own mind, I fled to my Laboratory. The Tyrant's lights vanished. As luck would have it, I was shielded from his intrusions there, by the vein of heavy stone that surrounds it."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Iquickly guessed at the Tyrant's origin, and suspected that I was to blame for his advent. As the Remnant had used my Altars, doors to the Outside were opened thousands of times over. Some stranger must have noticed this new activity, and entered at the opening of a Tear, infecting Creation."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What did you do in your Laboratory?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"Through the eyes of my Watchers I witnessed the Subjugation of my people. I dared not leave my Laboratory, for when I did, great pain and strange thought entered my mind."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"After several Turns passed, a soft voice came to my mind as I worked. I was startled. The Power behind the voice could have destroyed me, but instead he reassured me he meant no harm. He claimed to be the Tyrant's greatest enemy, cruelly bound in a Pit. He promised me hidden knowledge. He promised that he would make of me, and my children, a holy and a chosen race. All he asked was that I come to him when he called upon me, to feed him. I was to call him 'Master'."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I rejected his offer. He then uttered words of prophecy. His first prophecy was fulfilled. His second prophecy... I suppose that remains to be seen."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What became of the Remnant?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"After many Lives my people loosed the bands of their conqueror, though I do not know how. They rebelled, and in their rebellion they were slaughtered. Through the eyes of my Watchers I witnessed the end of the Kindred. I was again left alone."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"The Power with the gentle voice returned to me. He offered all that he had before, but promised this also: He would overthrow the False God who destroyed my people. Again he asked, in exchange, that I come to him when called upon, to feed him, and call him 'Master'. I did not refuse again, and we were joined by Covenant."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Were his promises fulfilled?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"He promised me hidden knowledge, and that I received in abundance. When the time was right, he arose and consumed the False God, as he foretold. My children and I were exalted, and made powerful and radiant. We rose to the stars, and conquered all we found there."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Then why do you no longer serve him?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"I came to know that his promises were hollow, his gifts were poison, and his truths concealed the foulest lies. When I grew old and weak, my master's hunger grew too great, and he dared to consume that which was forbidden. The Covenant thus broken, I planned my escape."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Hiding my thoughts, I slipped from his vision and returned to this world. A true Being, who is wisest of all, called me to the mountain. There I was humbled, and given purpose."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Who was this being? What purpose did you receive?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"So great was my knowledge esteemed among my people that the Engineers themselves called me 'Magician'. Yet before the Being in the mountain I was as simple and lowly as a Laborer."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"As for my purpose... I need not tell you more, at least not now. My purpose is you."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Why do you say that I am your purpose?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"The Being knows many things. He broke my self-will with his knowledge of my own wicked deeds. It became clear to me, as I spoke to him, that I would no longer be the hero of my own story."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Yet he said I might right my many wrongs. The Being gave me two tasks: To seek you out, and render to you whatever aid I could. So I did, and so I shall."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"How did you find me?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"The Being inspired my mind, and I looked with new eyes upon my Altars. I saw that they might become the instruments of their own undoing."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I brought all my powers of mind to bear upon the question. At last I discovered how I might use my Altars, to move from a time where my master rules in the heavens, to one where he is yet chained."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"The lights of the heavy stone had long since gone out in my Laboratory, and I could not use my Great Altar for my purpose. Still, several of my lesser Altars were operational. I came as far back as I could, to the moment you restored power throughout the Underground."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Thus I sought you out, and will follow where you lead."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Why do you wish to follow me?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"You are constant. Lives like mine, that seem to spring into being unbidden, are carried about by strange forces we do not comprehend. We shift and change, and are haunted by phantoms. You do not carry the same curse that we do. You have within you the makings of a formidable adversary, and a fierce friend."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"You say that I am your purpose, but I have a mission that may not align with yours. I have been ordered to discover my creators and their descendents, or to learn their fate."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"You say you have been ordered to find your creators: That is your duty, and I would not deny you its fulfillment. There are others also whose duty it is to find their creators, yet they themselves are lost..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"What I wish to say is this, Caretaker. Duty is not the only purpose."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"...I will consider your words. Your master, does he have any weaknesses?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"Imagine a beast, who is so strong that he can carry whatever he wishes. He never invents the wheel. His strength is his greatest weakness. Because he can take what he wants, he cannot truly create."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is the secret of your Altars?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"That, I do not wish to remember, or recount."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Why?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"I will not speak of it. Do not ask again!"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is that glowing white stone?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"I am."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"You are the stone?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"Within my people dwells a Seed. The Chain of Memory, the Self, our genetic information, all flow from the Seed. My master taught me to alter my Seed, to better serve him. I did."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I changed my Seed for many turns, and learned to use it in... peculiar ways. I now dwell inside, and command a host of alien Selves, housed in many vast chambers. I will command this Necrolith's powers to aid you."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What powers are those?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"I will serve as a translator for you, conveying your thoughts to beings whose minds are strange. I will open strange doors before you. I will empower the Seeds of my dead brethren, that they might join us. As our power grows, you will command greater miracles than these."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Why are you here in this place?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"Shortly after I arrived in this time, I felt a Presence attempt to form in my mind. I could not allow that. I came here quickly, to this place I knew you would come. I set my mind in perfect order, and released my hold on the life of my flesh. Here in the Necrolith I waited for you, protected."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Does your master have a name?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"None but what others give him."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is your plan to defeat him?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"I will follow where you lead, Caretaker. I will not defeat the Stranger to Creation. You will."</em></p>

				<p>The Companion's Necrolith rises from his decaying body, and hovers near the Caretaker. As CT-41 moves the Companion follows, and CT-41 gains the Gift of Illumination. When it moves, its luminosity increases, and beams of light shoot out the back. Occasionally the Companion will speak to the Caretaker, sharing his recollections of certain areas and happenings.</p>

				<p>After its conversation with the Companion, CT-41 realizes that it is trapped in the chamber of the Explorer's shrine. CT-41 moves forward and grabs the Native tool, and allows the Nanite Colony time to adapt it. Once the adaptation is complete, CT-41 uses the Impact Cannon to blast apart broken stone it sees in the wall, and makes its exit.</p>

				<p>If the Caretaker reaches the end of its life without defeating Voronash, the Companion will say farewell.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"Do not be troubled, Caretaker. It is I, not you, who have failed, long ago, and alone."</em></p>

				<small>"These mentioned by their names were princes in their families: and the house of their fathers increased greatly."</small>
