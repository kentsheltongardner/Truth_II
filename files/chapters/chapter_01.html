				<p>There is only darkness. Unintelligible noises, and then words, appear before a consciousness.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Voice: <em>"..."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Voice: <em>"... .. ...."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Voice: <em>"...and that should do it. Good morning! Can you understand me?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">Awareness: <em>"Yes, but I do not know how. What am I?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Voice: <em>"You're a Caretaker automaton, Colonial Assistant model, serial number CT-CA-00000041. I'll call you CT-41. You're able to understand me because I just exposed your language center to a comprehensive Standard English data set. It also sounds like your voice synth software is working great, and I can understand you perfectly."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Are you my creator?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Voice: <em>"Yes, in a way. I assembled you, and when I worked at Yamato Robotics I had a lot of input into your design. Now get ready, your world is about to get a lot bigger!"</em></p>
				
				<p>The universe changes. The blackness is replaced by globular, gray forms which slowly resolve to a sharp, saturated panorama of color. A thin young woman with long, dark hair sits in front of CT-41, a robot with a rectangular body, arms, and wheeled legs. A hatch is open on the front of CT-41's body. Several wires connect CT-41 to computers and diagnostic equipment, and the young woman interacts with a display inside the hatch. There is a crate on a wheeled base in the background, and tools are strewn about on the floor of a large storage deck.</p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What just happened?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Young Woman: <em>"I opened your eyes. Technically, I activated your visual systems. You now have a new way of observing the world around you!"</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What are you?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Young Woman: <em>"I'm a human; my name is Jessica Arai, but please just call me Jessica. I've spent the last few hours putting you together, and getting your language and sensory systems working. And now... I'm uploading a general knowledge repository, which you can query to answer the more mundane questions you'll have. You're going to learn a lot, in a relatively short time. Don't worry, I'll be here to help if there are any problems."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Okay CT-41, it should take about three hours to integrate the general knowledge repository. We can't move on to the next steps in your socialization until integration is completed and verified, so I'd recommend that you use time compression for a bit to speed things up. You should have that option available to you, somewhere near the top middle of your internal display."</em></p>
				
				<p>CT-41 opens its diagnostic and inventory menu, and uses time compression to reduce its awareness cycles while its carbon lattice brain is exposed to and integrates the general knowledge repository. After three hours pass, CT-41 resumes its conversation.</p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What did you do during the data integration?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"I set up some remote monitoring and communications tools for you, and kept a close eye on your data integration progress. It looks to me like everything took properly. Well done CT-41!"</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Where are we?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"We're on storage deck of the Argo... No, it's not the one you just learned about, I can understand the confusion... This Argo is a planetary colonization landing vessel. Yesterday we touched down on Lumen 2, the second planet in the Lumen system. This is where you'll be living for a very long time, if all goes well. You'll most likely be around long after I'm gone."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Where are you going?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"Oh, I'm not going anywhere, it's just a figure of speech. Okay Caretaker, before I approve you for general UCA operations, we're going to run a few tests together, to make sure no one gets hurt."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I have hidden ten virtual easter eggs on this deck for you to find. Even though they aren't real, you'll see them on your visual display. Your goal is to collect all ten eggs. Do you think you can do it?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Yes."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"You're a confident one, aren't you? Ok, I'm activating your motor control circuits, so you can get those wheels spinning. Go slowly at first! Once you've gathered all the eggs, come back and talk to me. On your mark, get set, GO!"</em></p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">The Spirit Of The Living Creature Was In The Wheels</div>

				<!-- As One Gathereth Eggs -->

				<p>CT-41 gains the ability to roll, push and jump. The storage deck is a tall room, stacked high with packaged goods. There are other crates, similar to its own, and shelves lined with assorted items. There is a large elevator that runs through the center of the Argo. CT-41 works its way through the storage deck, climbing over obstacles to reach eggs, pushing boxes into position to reach eggs, and pushing others out of the way. Once it has collected all the eggs, CT-41 returns to speak with Jessica.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"Good job CT-41! I hope your younger siblings learn as quickly as you do. Now that you've demonstrated nominal motor control, I'm unlocking the personnel elevator. It should handle your weight, just don't jump while it's moving. I have a new mission for you: I want you to use the elevator to find your way around the Argo, and talk to the other crew members. There's a lot you can learn from them that isn't in your knowledge repository, and they might just have some surprises for you!"</em></p>

				<!--In The Devices That They Have Imagined

				<p>CT-41 opens up its diagnostics and inventory software, and locates the Simulator. Only three scenarios out of ten are currently available, and CT-41 begins to play through them. Jessica created the Simulator alone and from scratch, and she designed and named each scenario within. The aesthetic of objects in the Simulator is neon, grid based and highly angular. CT-41's avatar in the Simulator is no exception.</p>

				<p>Each time CT-41 passes a scenario in the Simulator, a new scenario unlocks in the Simulator menu, such that at any time there are three unbeaten scenarios available, until CT-41 reaches the end. Jessica leaves bits of advice, encouragement and human wisdom throughout the Simulator, which CT-41 can read as it progresses.</p>

				<p>Once CT-41 completes the first three scenarios of the Simulator, Jessica speaks to it again.</p>

				<p>Good job Caretaker! I'm activating your motor control circuits, so you can get those wheels spinning. Go slowly at first! After you get used to real movement, I want you to find your way around the Argo and talk to some of the other crew members. There's a lot you can learn from them that isn't in your knowledge repository, and they might just have some surprises for you. "</em></p>
				
				<p>CT-41 gains the ability to move, and begins to roll around Jessica's lab. 

				-->

				<p>If CT-41 chooses, it can continue to talk to Jessica.</p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"You said I will live for a long time. How long exactly?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"I wasn't expecting an existential crisis so soon... Well, your exterior paneling should last indefinitely, and most of your components can be repaired or replaced if they are damaged."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"> <em>"Your brain isn't so easy to fix, though. Carbon lattice brains begin to deteriorate after a certain number of neuronal transactions, and yours has been rated for 2500 years of normal operation. I suspect that in this oxygen rich atmosphere the deterioration may begin sooner, but we'll hope for the best. Your insulated digital memory core should last much longer, of course."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What will you do now that I am activated?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"First, I'm going to get started assembling your siblings. We have several Caretakers with us, and it will take me a few days to get you all operational. You won't be alone here."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Where are you from? Why are you here?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"I come from Japan, on Earth. Why am I here? ...When I was a little girl, my father gave me a life-doll to play with, since I didn't have any brothers or sisters. I named her Kiyomi, and we did everything together. As long as I can remember I've wanted to bring things to life, and let other people experience the same magic I felt when I was young."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"So I studied robotics, and worked for several years at Yamato. That's where I helped design you. A few months ago, (or a few hundred years ago, depending on whom you ask), the United Colonial Administration contacted me, and asked if I would be willing to join an expedition as robotics specialist and handler for several of my Caretakers. I said yes, and here I am."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Why wasn't I brought online on Earth, like you were?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"Well, I'm a human, not an automaton, so we're brought online in very different ways. I activated you here because your carbon lattice brain develops and functions optimally when it's allowed to crystallize in its operational space. Now that you are functional you can explore the Argo, and put that new brain of yours to good use!"</em></p>
				
				<p>CT-41 can continue attempting to talk to Jessica, but is gently rebuffed.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"Go talk to your crewmates, CT-41. Once you do, Captain Garrett will have an important job for you."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"You should visit the Medical Deck. I bet Doctor Orozco would have a lot of fun talking to you."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"Let me know if anyone treats you poorly. That's not something I'm gonna put up with. You have rights, too, regardless of what some people think."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"Sorry CT-41, I'm gonna be busy working on your siblings for a while. You'll always be special though!"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"What are you still talking to me for? Get out there and make some friends!"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"So this is what motherhood is like... Go play outside!"</em></p>
				
				<p>If CT-41 tries to compress time for more than 5 minutes at any time before talking to Orozco, Ormeil and Kozlov, Jessica Arai will send it a comm.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Jessica: <em>"Sorry to interrupt CT-41, but it isn't naptime yet! Try talking the crew, they've all got something to give you!"</em></p>

			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">They That Be Whole Need Not A Physician</div>
				
				<p>After talking to Jessica, CT-41 moves to the personnel elevator.  Using the elevator, CT-41 is able to move up and down between the Argo's decks where senior crew members are working. Doors to several decks are locked.</em></p>
				
				<p>The first deck CT-41 visits after leaving the Storage Deck is the Medical Deck. This deck contains hospital style beds, surgical, dental, ventilation and optical equipment, and large vats of fluids. The walls are lined with storage units, where vaccines, cultures, and basic medical supplies are stored.</em></p>
				
				<p>At the far left side of the deck is an office, where CT-41 finds a darkly complected woman in her mid-thirties. The Caretaker finds her with her feet up on her desk reading from a tablet.</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Woman: <em>"Sorry, I'm a people doctor. I don't do oil changes."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"..."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Woman: <em>"That was a joke. You'll get used to them... actually, that would be defeat the purpose, wouldn't it? In any case, I'm Dr. Ines Orozco. And you are...?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I am a Caretaker Colonial Assistant."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Orozco: <em>"It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Assistant. Can I call you Caretaker? Good. You have any questions for me?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is your role on the Argo?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Orozco: <em>"All business, huh? My role... is to keep our human crew alive and sane, for as long as possible."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Why do you say it is your job is to keep the human crew sane?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Orozco: <em>"Space medicine has a major psychological component. Living on a world we weren't designed for can hurt us in subtle and unpredictable ways. Something as apparently harmless as the color of the sun or slight atmospheric variation can affect a person's mental health over time."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Fortunately for us I now have access to more than a century of literature, covering exactly these sorts of issues. I've been reading through medical transmissions from Jannah and other near-Earth colonies for the last few days, and I’ve gotten a good feel for the work and experiences of other colonial physicians."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What drew you to this mission?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Orozco: <em>"I think anyone who accepts a job like mine needs to be an outlier. I wouldn't call myself a narcissist, but former colleagues and... acquaintences... have described me as 'self-important'. I don't disagree; I take myself seriously, and I am important."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"On Earth, doctors cajole their patients to eat less and move their bodies. Out here, a doctor is the difference between a society's survival or extinction. I guess you could say... the further I am from home, the more I matter."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Where is your home?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Orozco: <em>"I was born in Buenos Aires, but moved with my family to Canada when I was very young. My D and A's predicted I would find success and fulfillment in medicine, and they were right, of course. I trained to be a doctor, and was drawn to space medicine."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"After graduation I got my first job at Lunar Base Alpha, and after 15 years there, my work caught someone's attention. Most extra-solar colonial tickets cost a fortune, but the Colonial Administration offered me this one for free, and of course I took it... aaand now I'm rambling. You ask a lot of questions, Caretaker. What can you tell me about yourself?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I began to exist today."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Orozco: <em>"Point taken. Anything else I can tell you?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What are D and A's?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Orozco: <em>"Disposition and Aptitude tests. Most people take them when they're young, to give them some sense of direction in their education. People joke that the D and A's help us find out what's in our DNA. I like to think I'd have ended up as a doctor even without the tests."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is cause for medical concern on Lumen 2?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Orozco: <em>"The usual: GRAT. (Don't blame me, I didn't make the acronym.) That's gravity, radiation, atmosphere, and temperature. Lumen 2 is very close to its star, and due to the planet's slow rotation, the day is very long. Colonists will have to wear environment suits when they're above ground, or they'll get burned during the day or frozen at night. You should be fine of course, your vital systems are thoroughly insulated."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"The gravity here is slightly weaker than on Earth, but I've designed an exercise routine to help our colonists maintain optimal strength and bone density. The atmosphere is breathable, but it's denser and much more oxygen rich than Earth's. If a colonist spends more than a few hours in untreated atmosphere he'll begin to experience mild oxygen toxicity, but it shouldn't be fatal. Terminal velocity should be lower than on Earth, so that's a plus."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"There are hundreds of other, more subtle potential dangers, but the ones I mentioned concern me most. Forgive my pessimism, but I've spent enough time with frontier types to know it's only a matter of time before I have to write out an accidental death report for some idiot who got tired of wearing his itchy environment suit..."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Jessica said you might have a surprise for me. Do you?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Orozco: <em>"Oh right, I almost forgot! This is a nanite colony, Caretaker. I've programmed it with your specs so that the nanites can keep you in good shape. They should be able to repair anything but catastrophic damage, given enough time. Try not to get into too much trouble though. The technology has its limits!"</em></p>
				
				<p>CT-41 receives the Nanite Colony, which repairs it constantly, albeit at a very slow rate. CT-41 can use time compression to reduce the apparent time needed to perform repairs. After its initial conversation with Dr. Orozco, CT-41 can return and talk to her again.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Orozco: <em>"Diet and exercise, Caretaker. Remember to get plenty of protein and leafy greens."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Orozco: <em>"Buenos días Caretaker, ¿Como estás? No? I'll talk to Arai, see if she has a Spanish language pack."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Orozco: <em>"Let me guess, you're pregnant. Who's the father?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Orozco: <em>"There's no easy way to say this, Caretaker... You're dying. You've got 2500 years, tops."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Orozco: <em>"Stop looking at me like that Caretaker, you're making me blush."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Orozco: <em>"You can't spend all your time in here, Caretaker. You know how folks love to talk, people might get the wrong idea..."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Orozco: <em>"I just don't think we're compatible, Caretaker. Isn't there some lonely power socket or digital interface out there that's more your type?"</em></p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Wild Beasts, And Creeping Things, And Fowls Of The Air</div>
				
				<p>After visiting the Medical Deck, CT-41 boards the central elevator and moves up to the Observation Deck. This level is much more open than other decks, and has large windows on all sides. Sweeping vistas of the surface of Lumen 2 are visible. The Caretaker sees a young man with long dark hair pulled back in a ponytail, dressed in shorts and sandals. He is holding a pencil and sketch pad, looking out of a porthole on the Observation Deck.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Young man: <em>"Domo, Mr. Roboto! How's it feel to be alive?! Jessica wouldn't stop talking about putting you together... It was getting on my nerves actually, so I'm glad you're up and rolling. Anybody given you a name yet?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Jessica named me CT-41."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Young man: <em>"You should be grateful, sounds like she put a lot of thought and effort into choosing that name for you, it has a real personal touch. I am Ensign Nicholas Ormeil, just call me Nick though."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Nick, what is your role on this mission?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Ormeil: <em>"I'm an exobiologist, on the first world known to contain living exobiology. I can see that there's primitive life here just by looking out the portholes. It's not just fossils this time, this is the real deal. ALIENS! I'm gonna give names to every beast of the field! I'm excited, man, and you should be too! Assuming, of course, excitement is something you can feel. Is it?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"No. What do you plan to do when your mission is over?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Ormeil: <em>"Did someone tell you this mission ends? Hate to break it to you, buddy, but this mission won't ever be finished. We’re here for good. I'm paraphrasing of course, but our orders are to stay alive as long as we can, and maybe learn a thing or two in the process. The only thing that goes back to Earth is the data we'll be transmitting when Westfahl sets up the comm tower. And even that data is gonna take #NUMBER years to reach Earth."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Why did you accept this mission, if there is no possibility of a return to Earth?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Ormeil: <em>"I'm here to explore strange new worlds, man, to seek out new life and new civilization. I have to die somewhere, right? I'd rather it be out here, turning the unknown into the known. It's been said there is nothing new under the sun... so leaving the Solar system is a great way to get around that depressing bit of wisdom!"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Besides, I don't want to get recced. Sorry CT-41, I'll try and cut back on the slang. What I mean is I don't want to spend my life in a rec pod. A lot of friends back home fell into that trap. Out here I'll be able to avoid it. In fact, I'll have to avoid it."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is your opinion of the other crew members?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Ormeil: <em>"Hmm. Jessica is cute, but she's a little too into her work, I think. Dr. Orozco is a little older, but she seems like fun... And if I'm being honest, my feelings toward the rest of the command crew and the useful officers could be best described as, uh, 'relative indifference'."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What do we know about the biology of Lumen 2?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Ormeil: <em>"Not much. The lifeforms we see on the surface and in the air are almost certainly carbon based, as you'd expect. Sitting here looking out I've seen blimp-like organisms floating by, and there are rock-like growths on the surface that I'm convinced are organic."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I've already sent out a couple of drones, and let me tell you, the critters on the surface did not impress me with their intelligence. Of course you're gonna be the first one actually out there mingling with the natives, at least that's the impression I got last time I talked to the Captain. Hopefully in a little while you'll be telling me all about them."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Where are you from?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Ormeil: <em>"Dude, I don't want to bore you. What do you have, like 10 exabytes of storage? You don't want to waste any of that precious, finite memory with the sad tale of Nick Ormeil's troubled youth. I'm on an alien planet, #NUMBER light-years from Earth. As far as I'm concerned, I'm born again, and my new life started when I came out of stasis."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"And speaking of your storage, I've got a much better use for it. Jessica had a cute idea, asked us to think of presents to give you on your birthday. I wrote you a software package I dubbed 'Scribe'. Using your sensory data, Scribe will create and maintain a high fidelity map of your exploration. You can leave notes and markers on it as well."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"But wait, there's more! Scribe also produces an encyclopedia. It'll analyze every organism and environment you encounter, and create an entry for each. Yes, I realize my gift to you could be seen as self-serving, because it definitely is, but I'm hoping it'll help you too. I think we'll work well together. Okay, Scribe's map and database should both be visible on your display. Do you see them?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Yes."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Ormeil: <em>"Sweet! Now get outside as soon as you can, so that Scribe can start producing data!"</em></p>
				
				<p>With Scribe installed, two new icons appear on the top left and right of CT-41's main display. CT-41 begins to build up its map and database as it explores, and can access either reference at any time. CT-41 can speak to Ormeil again after their conversation ends.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Ormeil: <em>"What allows the blimp-like animal to float like that? Is it helium? Hydrogen? Heated air? Jets? Artificial vacuums? Gravitic manipulation? Invisible tethers? Inter-dimensional projections?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Ormeil: <em>"Make sure to say hi to Flora and Fauna while you're out there!"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Ormeil: <em>"I wonder sometimes, how long it will be before speciation begins to separate human populations isolated by interstellar distance?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Ormeil: <em>"Fiction gets it wrong all the time. Why would DNA be a universal? Surely that structure isn't the only naturally occurring means of encoding genetic information..."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Ormeil: <em>"With a day that lasts #NUMBER years, adaptations to Lumen 2's diurnal cycle must be extreme."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Ormeil: <em>"Now, about reaching my reproductive quota, who shou... Oh, hi Caretaker, didn't notice you there. How are you?"</em></p>

				<p>Once CT-41 has finished talking to Ormeil, it again boards the central elevator and moves to the Reactor Deck. There it finds display terminals, exposed wiring and tubing, various containment vessels and a large reactor chamber. There is a gray haired, bearded man hunched over and typing away furiously at a terminal next to a reactor, who talks to CT-41 without looking away from his console.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Old man: <em>"Hello again, Caretaker. I hope rest of crew is being kind. I am Lieutenant Commander Kozlov, and I am in charge of manage science research. I am sure young one like you is curious about world, what you want to know?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Why did you say 'Hello again'? Have we talked before?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Kozlov: <em>"Is it the first time I speak to you? I suppose so... Is strange feeling... Maybe I have the deja vu!"</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What are you doing?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Kozlov: <em>"I inspect reactor. Power is steady, but is not optimal. Output must be optimal."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What can you tell me yourself?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Kozlov: <em>"Is not much. I am born in north of Ukraine, on shores of Pripyat river. When I am born, doctor see there is problem. I am very lucky for survive. I have mutation that make neuron always grow. The mutation has many side effect, very difficult, but Doctor Orozco help me to keep under control. From very young I find myself with interest in science work. When Lumen system is discovered, I am drawn to it, and I work many years for to come here."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is the nature of our mission?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Kozlov: <em>"I cannot tell you everything about mission, but I tell you what all crew member know. #NUMBER years ago, scientists at LIST (forgive, Large Interstellar Surveyor Telescope) begin to catalog planets for colonization."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Then we find Lumen. Three planets in system show signs of, uh, previous civilization. We say to ourself: 'Life evolve on Lumen 2, and maybe spread to Lumen 3 and 4.' We are here on Lumen 2 to see if can find leftovers of intelligent life, or maybe make contact. There is danger of course, but we decide benefit is worth risk, and cost."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What do you know about the Argo?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Kozlov: <em>"I know everything, because I design it! Well, I help design it. You already know about elevator, and you learn what you want of Argo by using it! You can visit any area of Argo as long as is allowed."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is my role in this mission?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Kozlov: <em>"Is simple: Your job is do things that would be danger for us. Human break too easy, but you are different. You are more strong, more fast and for some things more smart than we are. If you are hurt, or lose power, you can be fixed. Is not so easy repair human."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Why do you speak differently than the other crew members?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Kozlov: <em>"I do not learn English until I am already grown, and I am more smart for ideas and pictures than words."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What can you tell me about your scientific work?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Kozlov: <em>"I like to make things go fast. Example: I design antimatter rocket that accelerates propulsion module, and work with team to develop lander. Biggest antimatter rocket, very good work. I say to Colonial Administration, 'My price for help develop rocket is ticket on Argo', and they agree! Now I am here."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I also enjoy theoretical physics, as hobby. I develop agent theory, for to explain nature of matter and energy. Everything, even very small particle, is agent. Agent observes and interacts with other agent. Some agent is composite, and exist only a little time; some agent is fundamental, and exist from beginning. Composite agent adds information to universe. During transport Earth make much new discovery in agent theory, and I read, when reactor is not misbehave."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"But most I like make things go fast... and that is why I give you these! Jessica ask me to make present for you, so I make thrusters. They are make you move in air. I feel like I have other gifts to give you, but I not know what they are! Maybe sometime I make you new present!"</em></p>
				
				<p>With the Thrusters equipped, CT-41 is able to change its direction mid-air. Once CT-41's conversation with Kozlov ends, it is able to return and attempt to talk to Kozlov again.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Kozlov: <em>"Caretaker! Perfect time. What is square root of 11,672, to five decimal? 108.03703? Thank you!"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Kozlov: <em>"...it make no sense... Why is fluctuate?..."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Kozlov: <em>"No. Vadim is never wrong. Computer is wrong."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Kozlov: <em>"...maybe if I... I will adjust..."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Kozlov: <em>"...but that would mean... Is not possible!"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Kozlov: <em>"...Oh... Now I see..."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Kozlov: <em>"I am glad to see you, Caretaker. Please be careful outside, is more dangerous than seems!"</em></p>
