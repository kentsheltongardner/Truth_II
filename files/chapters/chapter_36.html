				<p>Once it has the Mass Inhibitor, CT-41 is able to begin its explorations of a new area of Lumen 2. CT-41 recalls a passageway leading east away from the Fuel Dump's borehole, one that was blocked by large stones. CT-41 returns to the Farsight Colony's Reactor, and although it could wait for the waste chute to open, instead uses the Tunneler to move past the trapdoor and falls down the borehole.</p>

				<p>As it falls it uses its Maneuvering Jets to press itself against the right side of the borehole, and falls into the passageway leading east. It must use the Mass Inhibitor to move several massive stones that would have once blocked its progress. Whether by pushing these stones, or toppling them from their perches, CT-41 uses the Mass Inhibitor to navigate through the stony tunnel that is the first portion of the Broken Path.</p>
				
				<p>The Broken Path is actually two paths that are intertwined: The cracked foundations and ruined facilities of an ancient Native Spaceport, and the torn and creviced caverns beneath. The entire broken path is marked by increased destruction as CT-41 approaches the region where the Destroyer Wreck crash-landed on Lumen 2. The ground becomes increasingly unstable, and sand filters down from the surface above.</p>

				<p>CT-41 must navigate back and forth between navigable portions of the Spaceport, and the porous crust beneath it, if it hopes to reach the end of the Broken Path. During its journey it sees evidences of relatively recent passage, including Native Flow and solid ration containers. Halfway through the Path CT-41 finds the remains of a Native Explorer, crushed beneath a slab of fallen foundation.</p>

				<p>Along the Broken Path CT-41 escapes from many sleeping ambush predators, roused from ancient slumber by the intruder that now braves their passage. Near the Destroyer Wreck CT-41 passes through the Deathtrap, a corridor lined by deadly plant growths that taxes its agility and nerve. Once it passes the Deathtrap, CT-41 falls into a pool called the Oasis, and finds a small shrine built on its shore. This shrine is highly reminiscent of other shrines found in the Upper Ruins and the Badlands.</p>
