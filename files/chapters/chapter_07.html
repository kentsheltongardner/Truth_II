				there shall be desolation
				In the city is left desolation
				desolation shall come upon thee suddenly
				the desolations of many generations
				this whole land shall be a desolation
				a desolation without an inhabitant
				a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness
				Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction
				I will make thee perpetual desolations
				open thine eyes, and behold our desolations
				ye shall see the abomination of desolation
				your country is desolate
				How are they brought into desolation

				<p>As CT-41 moves out of the Beast's Den, it notices several crude, stony barriers constructed by the Beast, similar to the one that blocked access to its trophy pit. It cannot yet break through these barriers with any of its tools. CT-41 encounters more Lumene life the further it moves from the Beast's Den, and begins to notice a change in the carverns. Many of the passageways CT-41 moves through are straight, except where linearity is interrupted by uprooted and broken stone blocks, accumulated sediment, and twisted metals. Much of the stone that CT-41 sees is decorative, and was shaped to beautify the tunnels and chambers where it is found. Although many creatures are present in this area, they are clearly not responsible for the advanced civilization that CT-41 observes, nor for its destruction.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves slowly and carefully through the Desolation, which is full of unstable rubble and pitfalls. It is forced to use the Sonic Auger and Flashlight frequently, and there are several passageways blocked by destructible stone and metal that CT-41 does not yet have tools to remove. In the deepest reaches of the Desolation it can currently explore, CT-41 finds portions of the collapsed Openings. It can see the structural supports and caps placed in the Openings by Explorers after the Destruction, to prevent debris from falling down into their operational sections.</p>

				<p>The ruination is absolute near the surface of Lumen 2. Stones are burned and cracked, metals are completely melted, and detritus is almost indistinguishable from surrounding rock and soil. After scattering dirt, pushing rocks, and fighting enemies to make its way through the Desolation, CT-41 moves back down through the crust toward the Upper Levels of the Mine. Here CT-41 encounters the first Altar of its journey. The structure is a brutal and undecorated monolith, set atop a large base in a dead-end chamber beneath the rest of the Desolation. Water drips slowly onto the Altar from stalactites on the chamber's roof, and wires claw at its base from out of the ground. As the Native structures in the Underground are currently unpowered, CT-41 cannot activate the Altar. Although it is plain in appearance, the Altar affects CT-41 deeply with its stark, utilitarian aesthetic. The rest of the Desolation was designed to be beautiful, and has been destroyed. The Altar was never meant to be beautiful, and is without blemish.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves up out of the Altar's chamber, and continues east. As it moves near a westward facing mine shaft, CT-41 finds the dessicated remains of a dead Lumene Native. This Native was one of the many Natives who did not reach the Womb before the Destruction, and was killed by penetrating radition unleashed into the crust by Destroyer Gateways. CT-41 finds a strange device next to the Native, which it cannot immediately use. The device appears in CT-41's inventory as a question mark.</p>

				<p>CT-41's Nanites begin to modify the items, and the adaptation bar beneath it begins to fill. When the device is fully adapted, CT-41 labels it 'Energy Shroud' and equips it. A shield bar becomes visible on the right side of CT-41's internal display, next to the integrity meter. From this point on, whenever CT-14's batteries are at maximum capacity, the shield bar begins to fill.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves east, away from the dead Native, and uses the Sonic Auger to open up a tunnel that leading downward. Soon it falls through the ceiling of a shaft in the Upper Levels of the Mine, and from there is able to return to the Farsight Colony.</p>

				<p>By this time, all of the standard elements of CT-41's internal display are present. CT-41's visual scanners produce a panoramic view of its surroundings, presented as a 512x288 rectangle. To the right of this display are two status bars, one which shows CT-41's structural integrity, and another that shows its current shields. To the left of the display is another bar showing CT-41's battery charge. All of these status bars start at and fill from the bottom of the screen. As CT-41 finds new shield, armor and battery technologies, these bars increase in size until they reach a maximum.</p>

				<p>The size of the status bars is limited by the presence of two icons at the top left and top right corners of the screen. These are the Scribe icons, which display the Map and the Database. When CT-41 selects either icon, a new display is presented over the standard visual display. CT-41 can place and remove markers from the Map, and add notes to each marker. It can also pan the map to look at distant areas, as by default the Map centers on CT-41's current position. The Database brings up a list of creatures and areas encountered. CT-41 can fill the Database up to a maximum number of entries, at which point it is considered complete.</p>

				<p>To view its own status and make adjustments to its equipment, CT-41 can either select itself on its visual display, or use a shortcut key. When it opens its Inventory, CT-41 sees several sections. Starting from the left are Battery, Power, Shield, and Armor columns, each containing 4 slots. One item of each category can be equipped at a time. Next is a grid displaying tools collected by CT-41. The lasers occupy the leftmost column of the grid, with other tools displayed in the remaining slots. CT-41 can equip or unequip tools to either arm by using its left or right selectors.</p>

				<p>Each laser has a vertical optimization meter in its item slot, to the left, that rises as CT-41 uses the laser and Optimus improves its efficacy. Tools and other items that are incompatible with CT-41's system have an adaptation meter in the item slot, to the right of the item. As the Nanite Colony adapts the item, the meter fills.</p>

				<p>Once CT-41 has the Necrolith, a new purple meter appears next to the power meter. This indicates how much energy is available to power Seed abilities. CT-41 can select the Necrolith to toggle passive abilities from empowered Seeds, and to open Tears.</p>

				<p>Thus far, CT-41's journeys on Lumen 2 have been increasingly difficult explorations of its surface and incursions into its crust. CT-41 first left the Argo, cleared the eastern edge of the Fortuna Crater of native lifeforms, and returned to the Argo. CT-41 then entered the Mine, and retrieved the Sonic Auger and Abelino Montes' PDR and his Recruit's Rank Card, and returned to the surface. CT-41 then passed the Perimeter Wall, braved the Caverns, found the Flashlight, defeated the Beast, recovered Nicholas Ormeil's PDR and his Ensign's Rank Card, explored the Desolation, claimed the Energy Shield, and returned to the Farsight Colony.</p>

				<p>During each cycle of its journey, CT-41 ventured into the wild, faced increasingly challenging obstacles, and returned to the Argo, the surface of Lumen 2, or the Farsight Colony. All of CT-41's forays so far are representative of its true journey, which begins now. CT-41 will leave all that is familiar, face the unknown, encounter and defeat terrible monsters of chaos, and return home again more powerful than ever, bearing new knowledge and treasures.</p>

				<p>Only CT-41's first mission to the small cave at the base of the Crater wall did not reward it with new abilities or understanding. That will not be the case in Truth III.</p>

				<small>"Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou shalt not know."</small>
