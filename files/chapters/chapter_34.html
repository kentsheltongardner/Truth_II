				<p>CT-41 returns to the elevator that connects the Geothermal Power Station and the Mineral Separation Plant, and descends to the Magma Dock. Now equipped with powerful armor and shielding, CT-41 is capable of a more thorough exploration of the Magma Chambers. CT-41 enters the Chambers in order of their proximity to the Power Station.</p>

				<p>Beneath the crust of Lumen 2, in the Division the Lumene Natives call the 'Underworld', is a liquid mantle. This mantle is made of magma that is neither as hot nor as viscous as terrestrial manta, but is still extremely dangerous to CT-41. By navigating through the Deep or through the Underworld, CT-41 is able access fve different Magma Chambers. Each Magma Chamber contains a unique biome. The four eastern Magma Chambers are all homes to Magma Worm young at different stages of development.</p>

				<p>CT-41 finds a thriving and diverse biome in the Magma Chamber 1, located beneath the Geothermal Power Plant. CT-41 explores cracks and crevices of the chamber, cataloging what it can of the local wildlife. Among many other strange creatures in the Magma Chamber CT-41 observes the heavily protected Magma Worm eggs that have attached to the top and sides of the Chamber.</p>

				<p>If is has sufficient shielding, CT-41 can move out of the first Magma Chamber through a passageway to the east. This passageway, and all passageways leading to the several Magma Chambers appear to have been crudely widened. CT-41 arrives at Magma Chamber 2 below the Upper Root Fields. This chamber is cooler than Chamber 1, and is home to hundreds of hatched Magma Worm infants, which flee as CT-41 approaches. Dotting the top of the chamber are many cracked Magma Worm eggs.</p>

				<p>CT-41 finds a magma lock leading up into the cisterns beneath the Upper Root Fields. The lock is surrounded by a crust of cooled Magma, which CT-41 breaks using the Impact Cannon. CT-41 can now use this lock to move out of the extreme heat of the Magma Chamber, to restore its shields and integrity if necessary. The underside of the Chamber is marked by many small Deep Root heat exchange bulbs.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">The Elements Shall Melt With Fervent Heat</div>

				<p>In order to reach the Magma Chamber 3, located in the Enclave, CT-41 must descend into the Underworld and press east against its powerful current. As CT-41 moves down a wide channel toward the Underworld, it passes through a heat and color gradient, and the magma changes from a reddish-orange to a bright yellow. The mantle of the Underworld is much hotter than Magma Chambers.</p>

				<p>CT-41 battles against the current, and passes enormous hive-like structures and tentacled grippers hanging from the underside of the crust. Many giant creatures navigate the Underworld, among them Magma Worm adults. These enormous Jormungids are the largest creatures CT-41 encounters in its journey, and are impervious to to any of CT-41's attacks. In fact, adult Magma Worms completely ignore CT-41 attempts to interact with them. If CT-41 attempts to descend further it will be damaged by increasing heat, radiation and pressure.</p>

				<p>In spite of the danger, CT-41 may choose to descend through the hellish magma storm of the Undercurrent. If it goes deep enough, it finds a strange iridescent surface of plateaus and valleys, and bizarre glowing creatures adapted to live in the utmost extremes of Lumen 2. Many of the plant-like lifeforms here are so hot that they appear to be outgrowths of the surface. In caves and inlets that reach into the Shelf the current abates, and CT-41 finds small deposits of Actinides, Materials which enhance an unknown tool. CT-41 collects these Actinides, but cannot reach more than one specimen at a time without being destroyed. If CT-41 intends to collect all of the available Actinides in the Shelf, it must return to cooler regions several times.</p>

				<p>After cautiously exploring the extremes of the Underworld, CT-41 moves up into Magma Chamber 3, located within the Enclave. It finds a new biosphere, dominated by Magma Worm children and enormous and ancient Deep Root bulbs, much larger than those found in Magma Chamber 2. The Magma Worm children here are larger than the infants, and each defends a territory within the Chamber which it has claimed as its own. Strewn throughout the Chamber are the remains of many infant and child Magma Worms, ostensibly killed during competition for resources. CT-41 may seek out and enter the burrows of these children, which will attack it. Each Worm will drop a small amount of Actinides when killed.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Thou Wilt Not Leave My Soul In Hell</div>

				<p>CT-41 moves out of Magma Chamber 3, and again down into the Undercurrent. Battling against the current, CT-41 continues east, finally arriving at a fissure leading upward. CT-41 follows a long and tortuous path, moving past forbidding creatures that line the walls. Pushing through the strange overgrown vegetation, CT-41 emerges into Magma Chamber 4.</p>

				<p>This Chamber is unlike the others. No animal life or Deep Roots are present. There are several burrows connected to the Chamber, but they are empty. Large pieces of the Lumene crust have fallen to the floor of the Chamber, among them sheets of magma that once cooled on the underside of the Chamber's Ceiling. CT-41 chooses to investigate the western portion of the Chamber first.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves across the hauntingly still Chamber until it finds a Pressure Vessel nestled into a crevice. The Vessel is almost identical to the Pressure Vessel still docked in Magma Chamber 1. CT-41 enters the still operational craft through its magma lock, and enters the pilot's compartment. There it finds the hard remains of a Lumene Native within a melted Dormancy shell, nestling a Native Seed.</p>

				<p>The Outsider speaks to CT-41's mind, informing him of the dead Native's identity.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"The Kinsman who piloted this craft was an Explorer, a Brother of my own Lineage. Speak to him, if you wish, and perhaps he will join us."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 moves toward the Explorer's Seed, and begins to speak.</p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Hello, Explorer."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Explorer: <em>"Whose voice is this? Don't tell me the gods of the Underworld actually speak to the dead..."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I am a Caretaker automaton, not a god."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Explorer: <em>"That's a relief. I've studied the great worms that rule the Underworld. In fact, one of the adolescents damaged my ship, in what I assume was a territorial display. I'd rather not think of them as gods."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"But don't think I'm letting you off the hook, Caretaker! I've never seen nor heard tell of your kind, in all my journeys. Did the Engineers make you? How did you come here?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I was created by a race of beings called 'Humans'. I came here from a distant planet, to study your world."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Explorer: <em>"Right. I have no way to verify what you're saying. Why did you come to this world? If I am dead, how are you speaking to me? And why am I in darkness?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"My creators brought me to this world after they found signs of a great destruction on its surface. I am speaking to your Seed with the aid of one of your Kinsmen, who acts as translator. You are in darkness because your body is dead, and your optical organs are disintegrated."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Explorer: <em>"I appreciate your frankness, Caretaker, even if the truth isn't pleasant. In case you don't already know, I am an Explorer, of the Kindred. Are we in my ship, in the eastern chamber?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Yes."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Explorer: <em>"I'm impressed, Caretaker. It couldn't have been easy to find me here."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"It was not. Still, I am more ruggedly built than most naturally occurring lifeforms, and I possess armor and shielding that enable me to endure extreme temperatures. I have taken many tools from the ruins of your people which have allowed me to navigate here."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Explorer: <em>"Why do you say ruins? Did the Destroyers return?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"No. Your race was destroyed long ago, by another enemy."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Explorer: <em>"I suppose I might have sat here for thousands of Turns, the pressure vessel was well engineered... Any number of catastrophes might have befallen the Kindred. I don't suppose you know how many Turns have passed since the inaugural Council?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I do not."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Explorer: <em>"Well, I suppose we Explorers were always doomed, ever since the Destroyers came."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"..."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Are you all right, Explorer?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Pilot: <em>"I'm fine, and you can call me 'Pilot'. It's just that... After the Destruction, we Expolorers were confined to the Settlements. We sorted, burned, crushed and stored trash. We were not granted the right of continuation. I certainly didn't want to die, but I couldn't think of a reason to live."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"In spite of all that, I was hopeful. I was selected for reintegration, and I might have still had a purpose, and a future. But now I am a blind, dead thing, and you tell me the Kindred is extinct."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I am sorry."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Pilot: <em>"Don't be, pity won't change anything for me. I just... I don't know."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I understand. As I told you earlier, Pilot, I came to your world on a journey of exploration. May I ask you for information?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Pilot: <em>"Certainly."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"If the Explorers were confined to the Settlements, how did you come to be here?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Pilot: <em>"Good question. After the so-called 'Magician' returned from his exile and revealed his Altars, the Healers and Engineers began developing a reintegration plan for us. Explorers with useful training would be given limited freedom of movement throughout the Realm, in exchange for services provided. The Rulers tentatively approved the plan, and selected a management team of Healers and Engineers to oversee its implementation."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Before the Punishment, I had been a marine and atmospheric pilot. I was selected to participate in a feasibility study for the Reintegration. Since we could no longer explore upward, I helped the Engineers design this pressure vessel, to begin charting the lower regions of the planet. When the craft were ready, I used them to explore the Underworld.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I studied several of the magma chambers, and passed through the Undercurrent all the way down to the Shelf. I found exotic lifeforms and material specimens, and brought them back to the Healers and Engineers to be studied. I was the first Kinsman to see an adult Magma Worm."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"But I suppose I pushed my luck too far. I tried to study a Magma Worm adolescent that lived in this chamber. I must have triggered its murderous territorial instincts. It chased me into this burrow. I thought I would be safe here, but the Worm collapsed the tunnel behind me in a rage."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"My vessel was damaged by the collapse. I waited as long as I deemed prudent for a rescue mission, but I knew it was highly unlikely that I would be found. I entered Dormancy, knowing that my pressure vessel would eventually heat up, and that I would die in my shell. It would appear that my hypothesis has been confirmed."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"From my first enrollment interview I suspected that I had been chosen to explore this region, not because of my qualifications, but because I was desperate and expendable. And you know what? I think that, if I could go back and make the choice over again, I would still come here."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What do you know of the Magician?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Pilot: <em>"I'm just glad they no longer call him an Explorer, and I'm not alone in that opinion. There is something wrong with him, and I think the Rulers and Engineers fear him as much as they respect him. I think he spent too much time alone, and in the dark, while his Seed solidified."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I sympathize with the outlaws that live in the Badlands, though they are misguided. I understand why some of the Reintegration candidates tried to steal during their work tours. But those are legal infractions. I've seen the Magician's lights when he's visited the Hearth. He has done truly evil things. I think he has buried the Shame."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"How many other Explorers were chosen for Reintegration? What roles did they fill?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Pilot: <em>"There were only a dozen of us, though the managers were planning on enrolling more. I think one tried to escape, and another two got caught smuggling equipment out of the Technopolis. Idiots. Getting caught could get the entire program shut down... though I guess that doesn't matter anyore, does it?</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"As for our jobs... I was the only candidate exploring the Underworld. The Rulers sent three of the others to spy on the Laborers' Locus. Can't say I blame them, the Laborers have been acting strange for at least a quarter-Turn. The rest of the group are busy recovering wreckage and data from the Shallows, and looking for dormant survivors of the Destruction."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Sorry I keep slipping back into the present tense, Caretaker. For me, it feels like less than a Bathing has passed since I left the dock. Anyway, as I was saying, some of my brethren were sent to find survivors of the Destruction. If only they had found a Warrior, and returned him to inherit the Frontier... I think that just might have forced the Rulers' hand."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I thank you for your willingness to speak with me, Pilot. In light of your situation, I would like to extend you an offer of friendship."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog"><em>"My translator possesses strange and potent abilities. He can empower your Seed, so that you see through my eyes, and accompany me on my journeys as a Companion. Will you join me?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I had entirely forgotten about your translator; he sounds like an interesting fellow. Maybe later I can speak to him. I feel like I may have just answered your question, but to be clear, yes,  will come with you, and do whatever I can to help you."</em></p>

				<p>The Pilot's yellow Seed rises up from the floor of the compartment, and begins to follow CT-41. With the Pilot as one of its Companions, CT-41 gains the Gift of Haste.</p>

				<p>After leaving the Pressure Vessel, CT-41 moves east across Chamber 4, noting the remains of two large Magma Worm adolescents on the floor as it passes. It eventually reaches the Chamber's end, and finds an opening. CT-41 warily moves forward into the opening, and down an unnaturally smooth tunnel. As it travels down the length of the tunnel it passes a section of broken rock, held together by a strong biological adhesive. CT-41 attempts to use the Impact Cannon to blast the rocks apart, to no effect.</p>

				<p>CT-41 passes through a wide tunnel, which opens into a cavern whose walls are covered with sheets of red hot, solid magma. Settled to the bottom of the chamber are the bones of a dead Magma Worm adolescent, covered in a thin veneer of cooled magma. Soon after it enters the room, the cavern begins to shake, and hardened magma scales begin to detach from the walls and from the bones.</p>

				<p>The front of a huge, living Magma Worm adolescent appears in the entrance to the cavern, and CT-41 is trapped. The Magma Worm fights against CT-41, attempting to impale it with a huge barb that it reveals when it retracts folds of scaly hide near its front. CT-41 dodges the thrusts, and the Magma Worm moves back into its tunnel, and begins to glow a radioactive blue down its entire length. When it finishes charging, it again reveals the spike, which emits a powerful penetrating blast.</p>

				<p>The beam, whose effect is instantaneous rather than sustained, deals catastrophic damage to CT-41. The battle is additionally complicated by the fact that CT-41's regenerate slowly, or not at all, in the extreme heat of the Chamber. If CT-41 moves too close to the Magma Worm, it will generate an enormous pressure wave that knocks it back toward the eastern wall of the cave.</p>

				<p>CT-41 is only able to deal significant damage to the Magma Worm when by targeting its orifice, and deals higher damage when its flesh is retracted. After dodging its attacks, and striking back with devastating force when it can, CT-41 blows the face off the Magma Worm, which dies immediately after as magma rushes into its body cavity. The hard spike apendage of the Worm falls to the floor, and CT-41 moves forward and claims it. The Nanite Colony adapts the weapon into the Criticality Lance, a powerful charged gamma ray beam that passes through any matter.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves into the body of the dead Magma Worm, and notices that its insides greatly resemble those of its Jormungid cousins, the Sentinels. CT-41 blows open the back end of the Worm, and moves up into its former burrow, where it finds more Actinides. When it looks at its inventory, CT-41 discovers that these Actinides increase the charge speed of the Criticality Lance.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Open The Mouth Of The Cave</div>

				<p>CT-41 moves down out of Magma Chamber 4, and attempts to continue its eastward exploration. It eventually reaches a narrowing of the Undercurrent, where the magma flows much more quickly than elsewhere. Regardless of what tools it uses, CT-41 is unable to move through the tight channel, and is forced to turn west.</p>

				<p>CT-41 rides the Undercurrent west, taking damage as it is carried through the blazing heat of the magma. It passes by Magma Chambers 1 through 4, and descends below the Basin. Here CT-41 notices section of jagged and crumbling rock on the underside of the crust, and moves up to investigate. Upon closer inspection CT-41 discovers cavities in the rock, where pockets of air are trapped. CT-41 uses the Tunneler to teleport into one of these cavities, but cannot use the Tunneler to return to the Underworld.</p>

				<p>CT-41 navigates through a series of broken caverns, fissures and cavities. No lifeforms are present here, but the instability of the chambers makes them very difficult to navigate. CT-41 must use all of its considerable brainpower to progress through the porous underside of the crust, before eventually breaking into the Rulers' locked Vault. Within CT-41 finds a wealth of Materials, one for each of its applicable tools.</p>

				<p>CT-41 cannot return to the Underworld from the Vault, and as such returns to the Magma Dock to continue its westward journey. It moves down into the Undercurrent, and continues west past the Basin, and toward an inverted valley at the base of the Volcano. Within this concavity CT-41 observes Silicate growths, apparently related to the Silicates it encountered in the Crystal Kingdom.</p>

				<p>CT-41 passes the cooled main vent of the Volcano, and finds a passageway west of the vent leading to Magma Chamber 5. Unlike the eastern Magma Chambers, Chamber 5 is not home to Magma Worms at any stage of development. The chamber contains the first mobile Free Silicates which CT-41 has encountered, creatures adapted to live among Silicates, and even creatures that encourage the growth of Silicates on their own bodies. The Silicates' song echoes loudly through the Chamber, in contrast with the occasional world shaking rumble of Magma Worms passing through the Undercurrent below.</p>

				<p>After passing through an increasingly dense maze of Silicates and other creatures, and taking several more Actinide deposits, CT-41 encounters another spongy section of the Lumene crust. Using the Tunneler, CT-41 leaves Magma Chamber 5, and begins to move east toward the main vent. It finds a network of wide tunnels that traverse the Vent, all similar in appearance to the ancient and unimproved Highways that criss-cross the Realm.</p>

				<p>CT-41 begins to explore these tunnels, and takes what materials it can find within the cooled magma. As it moves down, it eventually finds the resting place of the Old God Molech. This sleeping Titanid is the hugest and most powerfully built of all the Old Gods. Its hide is thick, and its appendages are tipped with metal infused claws and teeth which it once used to grind through the stone of its lair, and the Silicates to the east.</p>

				<p>As in all other encounters with Old Gods, CT-41 provokes Molech to wakefulness. Molech stirs within his gleaming, resinous shell, before bursting forth. Unlike other Old Gods, Molech is surrounded by a shining aura that pulses with life. This aura deals damage to CT-41 based on its proximity, but diminishes in strength as CT-41 deals damage. Only when Molech's radiating shield is reduced to nothing can CT-41 actually harm the Old God.</p>

				<p>In the shimmering heat of Molech's volcanic home, CT-41 battles against the last of the Old Gods. CT-41 must keep its distance from Molech, to avoid damage from the Old God's claws and shields. Molech possesses strange powers, and is capable of producing a powerful electromagnetic field that pulls CT-41 toward it. Furthermore, Molech is able to destroy the thinner walls and stalactites of his home, preventing CT-41 from taking shelter.</p>

				<p>CT-41 attacks Molech in cycles, whittling down its shield to nothing before unloading furious volleys of concentrated firepower. When it has dealt sufficient damage, Molech begins to overheat, slams against the ground in a rage, cracking the bedrock of the world, before finally exploding messily. CT-41 moves forward, and takes Molech's glowing Seed from its corpse. The Nanite Colony adapts the Seed into the God's Veil, an ultimate shield that increases CT-41's potential shield strength to the maximum.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves out of Molech's idolatrous chamber through an eastern passageway the Old God opened in his death throes. After a brief journy, CT-41 arrives again in the Crystal Kingdom that it explored long before.</p>

				<small>"And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the Lord."</small>
