				<p>On #DATE, CT-41 is awakened from sleep mode by an emergency summons from CICI, and its visual systems activate instantly. Since Jessica did not scramble CT-41's carbon lattice brain as ordered, CT-41 finds itself fully intact and functional. It observes its surroundings, and discovers it is in a dark closet of some sort, which its running lights illuminate. The emergency summons repeats every thirty seconds, interrupting any attempts by CT-41 to compress time.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">CICI: <em>"This is an Urgent priority communication: Any and all expedition personnel are under orders to report immediately to the nearest computer console for further instruction."</em></p>
				
				<p>CT-41 leaves the closet, and finds itself in a habitation with a bed. There are pieces of maintenance robots, a workbench, a desk, a stool, shelves with dolls, tools and several displays in the room. CT-41 approaches the door at the room's left end, and it opens. CT-41 moves into a clean corridor where soft but pressing sirens are sounding, and emergency lighting pulses red. After the door closes behind it CT-41 is unable to reenter the habitation. Doors to other rooms line the corridor, and at the end is a door which opens to CT-41. Inside is the Surface Access Elevator. CT-41 is able to move up and down in the Elevator, but finds the shaft obstructed as it attempts to move up past the Communications Level.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">CICI: <em>"Clifftop access is blocked by sediment build-up."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">CT-41 rides the elevator down, until CICI says <em>"Garage Level"</em>. It exits to the left, and finds itself in a large, cavernous room, lined with exposed rock and heavy girders. The space is filled with industrial equipment, rovers, digging machinery, tires, and crates. There are large cargo elevators to a lower room that CT-41 attempts to use, but CICI says <em>"Access Denied."</em> At the top of a stairway is a small office overlooking the Garage. Inside is a computer console. CT-41 turns on the console, and CICI speaks to it.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">CICI: <em>"Hello, CT-41. As an expedition member and Administration property, you are under orders to report immediately to the Communications Bunker, to receive a message from expedition supervisor Alexandros Myron. If you encounter any other Expedition members or civilians, please direct them to the Communications Bunker for further instruction."</em></p>
				
				<p>CT-41 moves away from the console and out of the office. It moves to the main door of the Garage, but the door does not open.
				
				<p class="character-dialog">CICI: <em>"Crater access is temporarily denied. Please report to the Communications Bunker."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">CT-41 walks back through corridor at the base of the Garage, and returns to the elevator shaft. Passing through the elevator shaft to the right CT-41 finds another corridor. When CT-41 reaches the end of the corridor CICI again says <em>"Access Denied"</em>. CT-41 returns to the elevator shaft, and moves up. It passes the Cafeteria Level, the Recreation Level, the Sanitation Level and several Habitation Levels before reaching the Communications Level. CT-41 enters the Communications Bunker to the left of the elevator shaft.</p>

			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">In The Day When I Call Answer Me Speedily</div>
				
				<p>The Communications Bunker is filled with chairs, desks, diplays, and wiring on the walls. At the left end of the room CT-41 activates a computer console, and the image of a man appears on the bunker's main display.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Alexandros Myron: <em>"This is expedition supervisor Alexandros Myron. For the last #NUMBER years we have received your scheduled bi-weekly updates on colony and personnel status, and we are impressed by and grateful for your work. However, we did not receive a status report during the most recent transmission window."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Under other circumstances we would assume that interference or a miscalibrated transmission array caused the interruption, but given the unsettling content of several recent reports, we are concerned about the safety and well-being of the colony and expedition personnel."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"We are aware that this transmission will arrive nearly one hundred years after whatever event or events precipitated the communications failure. Hopefully by the time this message reaches you, all issues will have been resolved, and communication reestablished."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"If it has not, anyone receiving this message is under orders, via the descendancy clause of the expeditionary contract, to resume transmission of status updates. If communication cannot be reestablished, per quarantine protocol we will not be able to render physical aid to a possibly hostile alien world. Thank you for your cooperation."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">After receiving the message, the sirens and emergency lights in the Colony are turned off. CT-41 accesses the console again, and is given the options to <em>"View Transmissions"</em> or <em>"Talk to CICI"</em>. CT-41 selects <em>"View Transmissions"</em>, and a transmission from #DATE appears. CT-41 selects the transmission, and Myron's message plays again. CT-41 then selects <em>"Talk to CICI"</em>.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">CICI: <em>"Hello CT-41. Do you have any questions for me?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Where are the Farsight colonists?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">CICI: <em>"I do not have access to any colony data from before #DATE. It is highly likely that on that date my storage matrices were cleared. Since #DATE I have only received status reports from automated systems throughout the colony. I have no record of contact with any colonists, other than you."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Describe the expeditionary contract."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">CICI: <em>"The expedition is not a standard colonial venture, and the expeditionary contract reflects this fact. The contract was presented to expedition candidates as non-negotiable. To protect the Administration's interests, candidates were given long-term memory suppressors before reading the contract and the mission outline. Many candidates rejected the contract's terms."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"The contract does not outline an independence timetable like most commercially licensed enterprises, and states plainly that all proceeds of the expedition, intellectual or material, are the property of the United Colonial Administration, or any successor organization, in perpetuity. Children of expedition members are considered expedition members and de facto signees of the contract. Non-persons such as yourself are property of the Administration, and are under obligation to follow the orders of superiors."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"How do I send a status update to the United Colonial Administration?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">CICI: <em>"I will send status updates. I will routinely compile your sensory logs, the contents of PDRs you have acquired, and other analyses and data you produce into a compressed bulk data file, which I will transmit to Earth. In fact, I have already sent a message informing the Administration that you are operational and have received their orders."</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Your immediate priority should be to explore the colony and the surrounding area to find other expedition members, or information relating to their disappearance. To help you carry out this task, I have just uploaded all available colony layout data to your map file. Please return to the colony frequently so I can transmit data on your progress to the Administration."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"After transmitting data, when can I expect to hear back from the Administration?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">CICI: <em>"It will be #TIME before the United Colonial Administration receives data you transmit, and at least the same amount of time before we receive a response. Back and forth communication will be a difficult and lengthy process."</em></p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is my remaining operational lifespan?"</em></p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">CICI: <em>"With intermittent repair cycles, you should be able to function until #DATE, at which point your carbon lattice brain will experience cascade degradation. Catastrophic damage will of course shorten your lifespan."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 leaves the Communications Bunker, and enters the elevator again. It can move to several different Habitation Levels, all similar to the one which it came from. The Cafeteria Level contains a kitchen and serving tables. In the Cafeteria CT-41 notices the skeletal remains of several humans, with tatters of Marine uniforms still hanging from their bones.</p>
				
				<p>The Recreation Level is a very large space which is apparently still under construction.There is visible rock and wiring throughout the room, and the floor and walls are not yet complete. There is a large window at the left end of the room that looks out into the Fortuna Crater. The Sanitation Level has doors at both sides, leading to sinks, showers and restroom facilities for males and females respectively.</p>
				
				<p>When CT-41 moves out onto the surface of Lumen 2 from the Garage, it sees that much has changed since the Argo touched down. The Garage it came out of has replaced the small cave where it found the carrion swarm and its still living feast. Lumen can no longer be seen in the sky, which is now dotted with stars. All surface water is completely frozen, and CT-41 slides where ice is present. The ground is paved, and there is exterior lighting pointing out of the Fortuna Crater wall above the Garage's door. The ground has been leveled, and light poles are present. The Argo is in the same spot it landed, but a foundation has been built up around it, along with permanent access ramps. It is weathered, and the words <em>"All Systems Argo"</em> have begun to fade.</p>
