				<p>Now that CT-41 has Nicholas Ormeil's Ensign's Rank Card, it is able to access new areas in the Farsight Colony, including a storage locker where Ormeil's possession were stored after his death, and the Power Plant. CT-41 first goes to the storage locker, where it finds drawings and models of several lumene organisms, and an Inspector. CT-41 takes the Inspector, which while equipped produces a visual overlay displaying the vital signs of creatures CT-41 encounters.</p>

				<p>CT-41 then moves to the Power Plant, which contains a Reactor, battery racks, power distribution apparatus and wiring, and water tubing. CT-41 finds and equips one of the High-Density Batteries from the battery room, doubling its battery capacity. There are computer terminals in the control room that show power output, expected timescales for continued operation, and a fuel dump schedule. CT-41 reads the schedule, which says <em>"Next fuel dump: #DATE"</em>. A fuel dumps occurs once every 7 years, and CT-41 uses time compression to move forward to the next opening of the waste chute at the far eastern end of the Power Plant. CT-41 enters the waste chute during its next scheduled opening.</p>

				<p>CT-41 falls down an incredibly deep borehole. The layers of the Lumene crust pass by rapidly, and CT-41 lands in a deep pool at the base of the borehole. This is the Fuel Dump, where many vitrified fuel canisters have accumulated over the many years of the Reactor's operation. The waste barrels continually heat the water, which boils around them, producing bubbles in their vicinity. Many of the spent canisters from the pool have been moved to surrounding chambers, where the heat they generate has drawn native lifeforms to them. These creatures are visibly distinct from their relatives in the Mine and the Caverns, and CT-41 encounters several entirely unique strains of life near the Fuel Dump.</p>

				<p>After exploring below and to the east of the Fuel Dump, CT-41 finds a nest of ferocious and highly agile creatures that jealously guard the narrow entrance to a chamber. CT-41 defeats the creatures and pushes through. Inside the chamber CT-41 finds a damaged drone craft of alien design, presumedly sent to explore the area at the base of the Fuel Dump's borehole. This drone, called a Watcher, clumsily flees from CT-41, who destroys it after a brief chase. CT-41 scavenges a Native item from the Watcher, which the Nanite Colony adapts into the Motion Sensor. This Sensor indicates the direction and position of any sources of movement.</p>

				<p>When it fell down the borehole, CT-41 became stranded in the Underground. With its current equipment CT-41 is incapable of returning to the Colony, and is forced to explore downward. Soon CT-41 begins to see signs of intelligent and creative minds, including intact Native habitations, stylistically similar to the debris and wreckage it saw in the Desolation. As CT-41 moves west, it finds another Altar, hidden in a dry and dusty secret chamber above the Menagerie. This Altar, like all other Native machines, lighting and doors, is currently unpowered.</p>

				<div class="margin-note">Creatures are abundant here in the Menagerie and Hunting Grounds due to the presence of warm Magma Chambers and producing Root Fields below. The Badlands sits atop a dead Magma Chamber, the Laccolith, and does not benefit from a significant, proximal source of autotrophic life.</div>

				<p>After leaving the Altar's hidden chamber, CT-41 moves down into an area containing many breeding environments and enclosures. The entire area is overrun with exotic lifeforms, captured, bred and cared for in ancient times by Warriors, and later by Healers. Here in the Menagerie Lumene Warriors trained pets and foes from creatures they found in their Hunting Grounds. In the kennel area of the Menagerie CT-41 encounters a Hunter, a formidable creature bred as a companion to Warriors during their long hunts. Although Hunters are slightly smaller than Beasts, they are more stealthy, agile, and intelligent. Hunters were trained to kill Beasts, and are a challenging enemy for CT-41. As CT-41 moves into the Loci of the Warriors and Farmers, it finds itself pitted against several Hunters.</p>

The Badlands sits atop a dead Magma Chamber, the Laccolith, and does not benefit from a significant, proximal source of autotrophic life.</span>CT-41 has the option to move east out of the Menagerie to the Hunting Grounds, an expansive area east of the Warrior's spartan Locus. Here CT-41 finds a wealth of Lumene lifeforms, including several Beasts. CT-41 is able to rapidly optimize its laser here, increasing its damage and efficacy. Near the base of the Hunting Grounds CT-41 finds a region where an entire cave system has collapsed, but it needs Impact Cannon to enter the Cave-in.</p>

				<p>Moving down from the Menagerie, CT-41 enters No Man's Land, an labyrinthine series of tunnels between the Loci of the Warriors and Farmers. Here during the Tribal Wars the Adventurers dug tunnels to the Root Fields, to steal the Farmers' herds and Flow. As the wars progressed, both sides dug numerous tunnels, blocked tunnels off, created traps, built barriers and listening posts, and redirected natural waterways. Navigating through No Man's Land is no easy feat for CT-41, but it eventually makes its way to the Repair Shop, where it finds and equips the Cyclone Drive. It then drops down into the Upper Root Fields.</p>
