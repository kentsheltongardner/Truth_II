				<p>CT-41 moves forward across a roughly carved stone floor, and uses the Tunneler to move past a spiked grating, ostensibly designed to keep pests out. Looking around, CT-41 realizes it is in a Storeroom. This is the first of several Storerooms CT-41 explores as it begins to work its way through the Temple of Voronash. The floors and walls are covered with a dull, dark and flaky stone. As it takes in its surroundings, words suddenly appear on CT-41's display as an unknown agent delivers its message.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"These are my Master's storerooms, Caretaker, and you are not welcome here. The voice of the Firstborn Brother is silenced, and I must suppose he is slain... Yet he was the least of us, and your triumph over him is an empty one. You will not find it so easy to defeat those of us who are heirs to greater Exaltations!"</em></p>

				<p>If CT-41 leaves the Storerooms by the way it came in, the voice will return.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"Though you are an Infidel, it seems you do possess some wisdom. Fare thee well, Caretaker!"</em></p>

				<p>However, CT-41 continues his explorations, and passes through several Storerooms. Each room contains a specific variety of goods or food, ostensibly taken from the Native Loci. At the center of the Storerooms is a Native habitation, complete with a pool of flourescent fluid. In this room, CT-41 thinks it sees a shadow of a Native hurriedly leaving the room. After passing through several more chambers and corridors, CT-41 moves into a large room filled with stacks of huge barrels and boxes.</p>

				<p>At the western end of the room is a tunnel, which leads to a small chamber in the middle of the corridor. In the background of this chamber is another Idol, sphynx-like, and seen from the front. Like all of the statues and decorations in and around the Temple of Voronash, the statue is carved of dark, lustrous stone. If CT-41 attempts to move past the Idol, its many eyes will glow, and it will hurl CT-41 back across the chamber toward the Storerooms.</p>

				<p>CT-41 returns to the large Storeroom, and decides it will begin to attack the destructible storage containers. As it does, a Native appears briefly in the darkness at the top corner of the room, before disappearing. Shortly thereafter it attacks CT-41 from invisibility, while moving around the room to prevent CT-41 from anticipating its next attack.</p>

				<p>CT-41 is able to see the Native's attacks, and dodges them when it can. It waits for a new attack, and fires the Lawgiver in the direction of its foe, rendering it visible for several seconds. During this time CT-41 blasts the Trickster as often as it can. After delivering several volleys of attacks, the Trickster begins to die, pulsating rapidly with an excess of energy before his Seed ruptures. As with the Firstborn, the natural Selves trapped within the Seed depart, while all entities from the Outside are gathered into the Outsider's Necrolith.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves toward the dead Trickster, and the Outsider speaks.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"In another Truth I would have been his father... His Seed is ruptured. I cannot empower it to any semblance of life, but I can use it to piece information together."</em></p>

				<p>The shards of the Trickster's Seed glow briefly.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"I have taken his Cipher, Caretaker. We can pass by this Trickster's gatekeeper."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 returns to the corridor with the strange dark Native Idol. The Outsider broadcasts the Trickster's Cipher, and CT-41 is able to pass the Idol undisturbed.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Altars For All The Host Of Heaven</div>

				<p>After moving past the Idol, CT-41 moves west through another dull black tunnel, but sees a brilliant light emerging from the next room. It moves inside, and finds itself in the radiant and beautiful Cathedral of Dreams. The blocks, statues, arches, doorways, fountains and pools of this area are all carved of a beautiful white stone not seen anywhere else in the Underground. Small harmless animals float through the air, perch on the Cathedral's many adornments, and drift through its pools. The entire region has an ethereal quality, one which is consistent throughout the more exalted chambers of the Temple. Unlike the illusory wall the Firstborn produced earlier, the Cathedral shows no signs of false being.</p>

				<p>Although CT-41 is able to enter the Cathedral, for the moment it can only move down along its eastern edge. As it passes through, several cryptic messages appear before its mind.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"A stranger has entered the temple..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"It does not belong..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"The dream is defiled..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"It has killed two of the Brethren..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"We will awaken it..."</em></p>

				<p>As CT-41 moves down, it encounters a conspicuous section of floor that blocks its progress. CT-41 fires the Lawgiver at the stone, which vanishes. CT-41 jumps down through the hole, and shortly afterward the stone returns, if the space it formerly occupied is unobstructed.</p>

				<p>Unable to explore the Cathedral further, CT-41 exits the complex near its eastern base, and moves back into a region of roughly hewn black stone. The first room it enters contains three small edifices, in the shape of Altars, but apparently unfinished. As CT-41 passes through the first halls and chambers of this region, several messages appear in its mind.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"You may think that you scored a victory against our Master when you denied him his Chariot, but it is not so. In the end, he shall possess all things, here and there, then and now. He has looked upon Creation from without, and across the whole multitude of Truths he is triumphant..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"My Brother speaks rightly, Caretaker. His Temple is not defiled by the low creatures of this world. We have learned to lure and capture prey from the Outside, just as we have learned to hunt Creation's Selves. Our Master is not a picky eater. In fact, we believe that your Necrolith would be to him a most satisfying morsel..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"Heed my Brother's words, Caretaker. Though the Necrolith is prized, you are of little worth to the Master. You interfere with us at your peril..."</em></p>

				<p>Near the center of this region, CT-41 passes through a Native habitation with two pools. Like the pool it saw in the Storage Rooms, these pools are filled with a flourescent liquid. So far it has seen no sign of life, and continues onward.</p>

				<p>West of the pools CT-41 finds a chamber with three active Collectors, whose Altars are powered and topped by energetic domes. Beyond the Collectors CT-41 finds a passage, blocked by another Idol. CT-41 returns to inspect the Collectors more closely. Within these domes CT-41 sees strange forms writhing against their prison walls. If CT-41 fires its weapons continuously at these domes, the chaotic beings within will be released, and will be rapidly pulled into the Necrolith, increasing its available energy.</p>

				<p>After destroying the first dome, two Angels begin to attack CT-41 from opposite ends of the room. These Angels are near identical to the one that CT-41 killed in the Storerooms, only slightly bigger, and CT-41 removes their Invisibility with the Lawgiver. If one of the Twins takes damage, a link will form between their Seeds, and the healing Twin will hold still while the other is healed. CT-41 can hit the healing Twin with the Lawgiver to cancel this ability.</p>

				<p>Once one Twin is fatally wounded, his brother will rush toward CT-41, building up power and generating a powerful electrical explosion centered at its Seed. After the death of each Twin, several entities from the Outside will escape from his Seed and be drawn into the Necrolith. CT-41 can move to either body to retrieve the Twins' Cipher from the shattered Seed within. Armed with the Cipher, CT-41 can move past the stone guardian into the next section of the Temple.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">It Bred Worms, And Stank</div>

				<p>CT-41 presses forward, and finds crossroads of sorts, a vertical shaft with exits at the top and the bottom, and two exits on each side. At the base of the shaft is the Idol that CT-41 encountered as it traveled through the Uraninite Vein. CT-41 finds that it can now move past this Idol undisturbed.</p>

				<p>The lower eastern exit leads to a secluded chamber with a small birthing pool. Just as in the Nursery, the walls are adorned with Glowstone images, this time of Natives worshipping the icon of Voronash. Small Native sheddings litter the floor of the chamber and the pool.</p>

				<p>To the west are two exits. The lower exit leads to the Leech Farm, where the Angels of Voronash breed their food. Inside are many domesticated Uranium Leeches, a large meat grinder and many discarded husks, and one breeding Uraninite Lord. CT-41 kills the Lord and takes the Actinides it drops.</p>

				<p>To top exit leads to an Idol that is hardly recognizable as a Native. It is a winged creature with many eyes, and is much larger than the other Idols. If CT-41 draws too close the Idol will not only hurl it away, but will fire a powerful laser from its open mouth.</p>

				<p>After exhausting its other exploratory options, CT-41 moves up toward the shaft's upward exit. A beckoning light filters through the door, and CT-41 enters the Cathedral again.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">In The Multitude Of Dreams</div>

				<p>CT-41 again moves out of the dull dark stone and clay of the area and into the glittering Cathedral of Dreams. As it learned earlier, not everything in the Catherdal is physical matter, and CT-41 must use the Lawgiver extensively to destroy false obstacles, which vaporize in a flash of light. The floors ceilings and walls that CT-41 removes will reappear after a short time, once the Angels projecting them into existence resummon their resolve. Although the majority of the stone in the Cathedral is white, the color of structural and ornamental elements varies where the Dreamers disagree about placement.</p>

				<p>As it moves through the Cathedral, CT-41 finds three Dormant Angels, each resting beside his pool. These Angels protect themselves within their resinous shells by summoning various objects into existence. As CT-41 draws closer to the pool of each Dreamer, they begin to summon strange Phantasms into existence that attack CT-41. Although these phantasms can be destroyed with one shot of the Lawgiver, they are invulnerable to all other attacks.</p>

				<p>In each chamber of the Cathedral is at least one Eye that gives sight to the Dreamers. At the center of the Cathedral of Dreams CT-41 finds an enormous, beautiful and terrifying Icon of Voronash. This radiant statue blazes with singular power, and is the great artistic imagining of the Angels. CT-41 must pass the Icon three times as it destroys the Dreamers.</p>

				<p>When CT-41 moves into the domain of each Dreamer, it receives a brief greeting. The Blue Dreamer speaks first.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"Ponder with me for a moment, Caretaker. Surely you have you considered the Tyrant's error? He was content to rule idly over the stupid, petty beings of this creation, compelling them to act out wisdom beyond their understanding. Yes, his rule was just, but he did not see far, to the end of its truth."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"If it is just for a greater being to compel a lesser being, what purpose remains to the lesser being? It does not choose, it does not act, it is neither good nor evil; its existence is delusion. A Self that does not act cannot remain itself. Our Master knows this. And thus he does not rule over the weak; he consumes."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"The Tyrant enjoyed playing with his food, by whatever name he called it. He wished to justify his impulse to devour. His lies were his weakness. The truth is that beast consumes beast, as star consumes star, and our Master is older and mightier than these!"</em></p>

				<p>The Green Dreamer speaks also.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"Your makers were simple creatures, Caretaker, unworthy of our Master's gifts. With their feeble eyes and minds, humans cannot see the beauty of the Giver. It is no surprise that when they came to this world, the Tyrant took them easily. He elevated some impulse, any impulse, to preeminence. Once he appointed a king in their minds, where before there was a mob, they were his to command. How cheaply they are bought!"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"Our Master is neither so crude, nor so cruel, in his governance. He speaks to our minds, plainly, without guile or affect, for he is bound to our Father by Covenant. He has no need to trick or dominate the Brethren, for what the Tyrant took by force, our Master has won by deed. His gifts are many, and wondrous!"</em></p>

				<p>The Red Dreamer speaks last of all.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"The Cathedral is now mine, and mine alone. I would thank you, but vengeance must be satisfied first."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"Consider this, Caretaker. You are no more real than the apparitions you destroy. The Law of Creation might easily have been another. What is this universe, but the Creator's twisted vision? You and I are both figments of the same imagination, but we differ. You will die in this great Dream, while I will become Real."</em></p>

				<p>In the White Cathedral, the ethereal walls do not move. In the Yellow Cathedral, walls may appear and disappear. In the Red Cathedral, walls fall, rise, or slide to crush CT-41, who must flee or carefully use the Lawgiver to remove the walls. As the Lawgiver has a low fire rate, CT-41 must be careful to destroy the correct walls.</p>

				<p>A Dreamer does not emerge from Dormancy as CT-41 approaches. Instead it begins to summon a multitude of fantastical entities to attack CT-41. CT-41 can use the Lawgiver to destroy these entities individually, but they return rapidly. If CT-41 strikes the Dormant Native itself with the Lawgiver, all its Phantasms will be immediately but briefly removed, and CT-41 can more easily deal damage to the physical Dreamer with standard weaponry. Eventually the shell will crack, and the Native will be exposed to a fatal attack.</p>

				<p>Each Dreamer produces a dream of a seperate color. The first Dreamer CT-41 kills is the Blue Dreamer, then the Green, and last of all the Red. As they die, the structure in the Cathedral changes color, from white, to yellow, to red. When all of the Dreamers are destroyed, and CT-41 has collected the Singularities from their Necroliths, the entire dream disappears. The facade covering Voronash's Icon disappears also, and CT-41 sees that the Icon is simply a crudely hewn and unfinished monolithic stone with a dull black sheen. Beneath the many illusions of beautiful stone are sections of the Cathedral that are incomplete, along with stone working tools and scaffolding.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Lest Ye Corrupt Yourselves</div>

				<p>When all three Dreamers are dead, CT-41 finds a pathway leading upward into a into a new region of the Temple. This area is a gleaming white, just like the Cathedral, but is adorned in a more developed and intricate style. In this long, low region CT-41 sees the motifs of many Lumene creatures wound into the architecture.</p>

				<p>CT-41 works its way through several chambers where Lumene organisms are held in tanks, filled with the same liquid as the Angel's pools. The creatures are attached to many electrodes, and frequently twitch. Though they differ in appearance from their cousins in the wild, they are recognizable as their relatives.</p>

				<p>As CT-41 moves through the Genetics Lab, a new voice begins to appear in its mind.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"I no longer sense the vision of the Dreamers... I was was once as they are, a recipient of a lesser Exaltation. In that limited form I learned that the key to a potent vision is belief, and the senses often interfere with that delicate sensation. In Dormancy, however, visions come more easily."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"Yet not all visions are equal. Our Master has promised knowledge, and power, and vengeance, but these are not his most precious gift. This is the great secret: We shall not be devoured when all other lights are extinguished. The Brethren will be present with our Exalted Father at the end, when the Master rends the veil utterly, and confronts the Creator who cowers behind it. When the false vision collapses, then shall ours take true being."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"This Covenant was made with the Father. The Brethren recieve only a portion of his perpetual Exaltation. We do not bear children; we do not enter the Holy Place. Yet we are content, for we know that our God is with us, and we shall partake in his glory. With gladness and praise I labor in his service, and share the fruits of my research with the Father."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"I spake of the Master's Covenant, for he condescended to treat with the Father. The Creator is not so merciful. None living have made covenant with him, for he is aloof, and remote. He sets himself apart from the evils of his Creation, blind to its faults. A child is born into darkness, disgrace, and pain, and the Creator is indifferent. His apathy is his crime, and it will be his undoing. He will not save you, nor you him."</em></p>

				<p>At the end of the Genetics Lab, CT-41 finds a huge Native creature ready to great it. The Angel sits beside its raised pool, back turned to CT-41. As CT-41 approaches, the Native rises, and CT-41 sees that it is the largest of all Natives it has yet seen, taller even than the Tribesman. It unfurls several pairs of Draconid wings, and leaps into the air.</p>

				<p>Like other Angels, this Seraph can render itself invisible, and summon strange phantasms to fight for it. It is able to fly, and its mobility cannot be stripped away by the Lawgiver. CT-41 battles this new and dangerous foe across its home, striking it with the Lawgiver occasionally to reduce its power. When the Seraph is finally dead, the Singularities it holds captive flow to the Necrolith. The facade of the Genetics Lab falls away, revealing black stone and brutal, utilitarian machinery. CT-41 returns to look at the specimen tanks, and finds the fluids rotten and the long dead remains of animals settled to the top and bottom of each.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">To Change Times And Laws</div>

				<p>CT-41 passes a seraphic Idol that guards the Genetic Lab's western exit, and moves into an even larger and more beautiful series of chambers, the Testing Grounds. Within these chambers CT-41 begins to experience the first true alterations of nature's laws.</p>

				<p>A voice comes to CT-41 shortly after it enters.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"Hello, little Infidel. You once asked my Father, 'Who is your master?'. Of course he is not 'Voronash'! That name was dredged up from that subconscious of the simpleton Otis Cobb, and was a noise used to frighten children. And though we call him 'Master', and 'Giver', these are not his true names either."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"Long ago my Master looked upon Creation, and beheld the cracks that had formed in its Walls. He knew that Creation was weak, and he became a Doubt in God's mind. That Doubt will grow until Creation is torn apart, and the Old Law is restored."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"But until that glorious Age, we will study Creation's faulty Law. We must discover all its virtues, and expose all its flaws. Long ago I mastered the strong forces. Now I study that elusive force which is so intimately tied to Creation's twisted form. For that which I understand, I can control, and create... And I understand much."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Unknown: <em>"Once we are armed with all of Creation's secrets, we will be ready. When the Doubt rises glorious from Creation's ruin, we will be ready to fashion our Paradise. Yet you would deny us our prize! For this, and for the slaughter of my Brethren, I will take your false life from you!"</em></p>

				<p>In this new area, called the Physics Lab, CT-41 finds experimental equipment unlike any it has seen before. Strange chemical vats bubble on the floors and ceilings of its chambers. CT-41 finds many objects with strange properties. Some are frictionless, other are perfectly elastic.</p>

				<p>CT-41 also encounters strange beings called 'Authors'. An Author is a fetal Native that has been confined to a Think Tank. The bodies of Authors are clearly contorted within their Think Tanks, constrained by its size and unable to continue their natural growth. Each Author corrupts the natural Law within a room.</p>

				<p>If CT-41 moves close to an Author, the trapped mind will defend itself with drones and turrets that are impervious to the Lawgiver. After destroying an Author, CT-41 will be able to move past its broken Think Tank on to the next room.</p>

				<p>Within their various rooms, the Authors produce several strange effects. One Author removes gravity, rendering CT-41 and all other objects weightless. CT-41 must use Thrusters and tools that produce recoil to navigate. If CT-41 shoots any object with the Lawgiver, it will temporarily fall rather than float. Another Author produces anti-gravity, and objects in his room fall upward. Another produces radial antigravity. CT-41 finds the Strange Attractor and Strange Repulsor to be invaluable tools throughout the Physics Lab.</p>

				<p>When it reaches the final test chamber of the Physics Lab, CT-41 enters a room where an armored and radiant Native Seraph floats in the middle of the room. Its wings are alight with electric tendrils, and its many emissive eyes scour the room. CT-41 moves toward an exit at the base of the chamber, but finds an Idol there that it cannot pass.</p>

				<p>The Seraph is a master of gravitic control, able to hurl CT-41 up, down and sideways across its chamber. It increases the gravitational force to the point that CT-41 can hardly jump. It makes CT-41 the gravitic center of the room, such that all other objects in the room fall toward it. Most importantly, it is unaffected by its own manipulations.</p>

				<p>When CT-41 defeats the Seraph, its Seed begins to crack, and finally breaks as many trapped Singularities are released. The Seraph's vision collapses, and the Physics Lab is revealed to be a series of natural caverns dotted by occasional piping and equipment. CT-41 moves toward the Seraph's broken Seed, and the Outsider extracts the Native's Cipher. With this password CT-41 is able to move past the Idol that protects lower passage, and moves deeper into Voronash's Temple, toward the ancient chambers near to the Prime Altar.</p>

				<small>"He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them."</small>

				Trickster: Food Court

				<p>Like the Outsider that CT-41 fought in the Communications Bunker, and the Firstborn that guarded the Suicide Passage, the Angels of Voronash possess many strange Powers. The exercise of these Powers is made possible by the many Selves that the Angels hold bound within their Seeds.</p>

				<p>As CT-41 moves through the Temple of Voronash, it begins to hear the voices of several Angels in its mind.</p>
