				<p>CT-41 begins to move through the smoothly sloping Highway. This tunnel is very tall, and largely unobstructed. It is paved at the top and bottom with clean decorative stone, but its gently winding, organic shape is distinct from other orthogonal tunnels created by Lumene Natives. CT-41 is taken aback by the size of the tunnel, and with its Flashlight equipped begins to cautiously explore. CT-41 moves up and to the east, but finds only dead ends terminating in unpowered doors without exposed wiring. After becoming more comfortable with the Highway, CT-41 realizes it can move fairly quickly through it, in spite of its size.</p>

				<p>CT-41 rolls down and to the west through the Highway, and finds several doors leading down. One, a door leading to the Geothermal Power Station, shows signs of damage, and there is a patch of exposed wiring near it. CT-41 powers the door, which opens, and takes plunges into the Power Station. Like the Distribution Center, the Power Station has experienced a Vermin infestation, but several new elements are present here. The Geothermal Power Station is not lifeless, and CT-41 must fight its way through several strains of Lumene life. Here it learns that electricity from the Volt Gun arcs to any number of additional targets, whether they are enemies or conductive objects, if they are close enough to the primary target. CT-41 uses the Volt Gun to defend itself from enemy creatures that attempt to swarm it, and stuns entire crowds in order to reposition.</p>

				<p>In addition to many other creatures, CT-41 finds many live Vermin in the the Geothermal Power Plant. Live Vermin will seek out and attach themselves to exposed wiring, and when attached will keep the chamber the are in unpowered. CT-41 can restore flickering, intermittent power in individual chambers where it destroys live Vermin or lures them off of their wires. If a Vermin is attached to wiring in a given room, using the Volt Gun will not be able to power objects in the room, as the Vermin simply absorbs all electricity in the wiring. If CT-41 attempts to fight Vermin with the Volt Gun, they will be healed and energized by its attacks. Vermin will be able to heal if they latch onto CT-41 and drain its energy.</p>

				<p>In the Geothermal Power Station CT-41 finds many conductive crates it can push, and uses these crates to carry current from the end of one exposed wire to another. CT-41 must create its own circuits using boxes, robots, and even conductive enemies, as electricity from the Volt Gun bounces to proximal targets. CT-41 also encounters batteries, which can be hit with multiple blasts from the Volt Gun. Charged batteries will power a room for some finite amount of time, allowing CT-41 to acheive its goals if it moves quickly.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves through many chambers in the Geothermal Power Plant, through condensation vaults, a water reservoir, distribution rooms, maintenance crawlspaces, control rooms and supply closets. As it does so it encounters larger and larger Vermin attached to high diameter wiring near the turbine room. As it kills them, the rooms the Vermin parasitized grow brighter and brighter. Still, power is only restored locally. CT-41 finally reaches the turbine room, where massive generators spin rapidly. Latched to one of these wire is an enormous creature called the Vermin Supreme. It ignores CT-41 until it is attacked, and then responds with devastating electrical attacks. Like other Vermin, it is energized and healed by the Volt Gun. Once CT-41 deals sufficient damage to it, the Vermin Supreme detaches from the wiring. Like other Vermin, the Vermin Supreme can fly, and it pursues CT-41 and lashes out at it. It periodically returns to the wiring to recharge.</p>

				<p>Complete power is immediately restored to the Underground whenever the Vermin Supreme leaves its wiring, and while it is detached CT-41 is able to leave its chamber. However, if the Vermin Supreme is still alive when CT-41 leaves, power will again be lost. CT-41 will then have to work its way around back the the turbine room. If CT-41 can prevent the Vermin Supreme from returning to its wiring for enough time to deal fatal damage, the Vermin Supreme will fall to the ground, and power will be permanently restored to the Underground. CT-41 can then move freely through the Geothermal Power Station. In the unadorned caverns surrounding the Geothermal Power Station, CT-41 notices evidences of ancient Farmer dwellings and Root Fields, displaced by technology. In some places Deep Roots and other vegetation has grown into the Power Station.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves back to the Farmland to explore it more thoroughly, and enters a new area where Lumene Natives constructed large bio-reactors called Flesh Vats. Hidden between two of the Flesh Vats CT-41 finds the body of a Native Laborer, pitiably withered. As CT-41's lights draw close, the Laborer's Seed begins to gleam like Glowstone, but CT-41 cannot yet communicate with the dead Seed. It instead marks this conspicuous place on its map, and continues its journey.</p>
