				<p>CT-41 is still eager to explore the Native Realm, and returns to the Altar in the Excavation. It selects as its destination the Altar near the Geothermal Power Station, and in an instant is carried through hundreds of meters of the Lumene crust. It hops off the Altar, and moves through the Power Station to the Highway. It rolls west along the Highway and enters the Assembly Hall, whose door is now powered. This is an enormous artificial cavern, whose space is broken up frequently by structural columns lined with perches, and large pedestals. Lighting in the Assembly Hall is low, and dims completely if CT-41 moves onto any of the seven pedestals in the room. These pedestals rise high above the floor when their Glowstone controls are activated.</p>

				<p>As it nears the center of the Hall, CT-41 notices decayed Native and Servant remains with increasing frequency. These Natives and their foes were killed during the Uprising and the Slaughter, as a large group of Natives made their last stand in the Assembly Hall. Among the remains CT-41 finds the Warrior's Shield. As CT-41 moves through the Assembly Hall, Cryptflies and other creatures nested in the dark, vaulted heights of the room swoop down and attack it, and water drips through the ceiling above. There is a door from the Assembly Hall leading downward toward the Rulers' Locus, but CT-41 cannot yet activate the Rulers' Locus Doors.</p>

				<p>Among the ruin CT-41 sees the broken, metallic body of a Bronze Executor, surrounded by many dead Beasts and other creatures, and pressed back against a large fallen stone dais. CT-41 is unable to leap over or destroy the stone, and travels east up the Highway.</p>

				<p>Later, when it enters the Assembly Hall from the west, CT-41 sees the remains of stone barricade that long ago held the passage to the Hall shut.  CT-41 finds a large group of dead Natives and Servants on the western side of the room, some apparently still locked in combat. The Seeds have been ripped from Native and Beast alike. The layout of the room suggests the truth, that the Natives had sealed off the western entrance to the Hall from Thosmodeme's Servants, but had been unexpectedly flanked from the east.</p>

				The Sea And The Dry Land
				Into The Midst Of The Sea
				In The Heart Of The Sea
				Unto The Uttermost Sea

				-->

				<p>CT-41 continues up the Highway until it finds a tunnel leading west toward the Sea, the largest single chamber in the Underground. When it enters the chamber of the Sea, CT-41 notices that it has not been shaped by Lumene Natives. Other than the door, which is above the high waterline, grated piping below the lower waterline, and artificial platforms attached to natural stone, there is little evidence of Native alterations to the Sea.</p>

				<p>Although CT-41 may not realize this yet, most of the rain that falls and snow that melts in the Fortuna Crater seeps into the ground, and eventually gathers in the Sea. Thus the water level of the Sea rises and falls according to the season on the surface. During a given Lumene Turn, the Sea is high at dawn, low during the day, high at dusk, and low at night. CT-41 notices differences in the coloration of Native platforms and natural stone above, below and in-between the high and low water levels.</p>

				<p>Soon after entering the Sea, CT-41 encounters a barrier it cannot pass. Depending on the season, the water level will be either too low or too high for CT-41 to continue. It decides to compress time, and as the many years of a quarter-Turn pass, the water level rises or lowers, allowing CT-41 to continue west across the great Sea. As it uses its thrusters to forge ahead, CT-41 encounters many obstacles, including several that require time compression to surmount.</p>

				<p>The Sea itself is occasionally interrupted by platforms and rocks that span the cavern, or rise up from the depths. Halfway across the Sea CT-41 begins to discover floating rectangular containers, relics of previous Native habitation. CT-41 is able to push the containers, and finds them useful as it moves across the Sea. CT-41 needs several Turns to pass as it crosses the Sea, and uses many different tactics to continue its westward progress. These include:</p>

				<div class="indented-list">
					<p>Raising and lowering the water level to pass over and under barriers.</p>
					<p>Using dry areas to gain speed for jumps.</p>
					<p>Falling into water from great height to pass under barriers.</p>
					<p>Moving under barriers while the water level is low, remaining there while water level rises, and gaining upward velocity after coming out from under the barrier in order to boost out of water onto high ledges.</p>
					<p>Moving containers in order to jump onto them, and then onto high ground.</p>
					<p>Lowering water to strand a container on ground.</p>
					<p>Trapping a container under a barrier in order to bridge a horizontal gap.</p>
					<p>Lowering a container on top of itself in order to carry it.</p>
					<p>Stacking multiple containers.</p>
					<p>Pushing rocks into the water to jump off of them.</p>
				</div>

				<p>As CT-41 moves further into the Sea, it begins to encounter some small lifeforms that float on the water's surface, swoop down from above, or ascend from the depths of the Sea, drawn by curiosity or the prospect of food as CT-41 disturbs the waters. Although these lifeforms are not particularly threatening, they will pulls CT-41 out of time compression if they threaten its safety.</p>
