				<p>After leaving the Ancestral Halls, CT-41 looks at markers it has left on the Map to get an idea for where it might explore next. It recalls the collapsed tunnel at the base of the Mine that it could not pass through previously. CT-41 moves to the base of the Mine, and heads west until it reaches the stony rubble of the collapse. Using the Impulse Cannon and Sonic Auger it blasts the stone and soil apart, and moves through the tunnel.</p>

				<p>Eventually CT-41 reaches a crude stairway carved into stone, heading downward. At the base of the stairway are two locked doors, similiar in style to the doors in the Farsight Colony. As it cannot enter these doors, CT-41 heads back up the stairway, and finds a stony overhang across from the stairway. CT-41 gets a rolling start, and is just barely able to leap to the overhang. Part of the stone face above the overhang is visibly weakened. Water soaks through it, and then drips from the overhang. CT-41 blasts the stone apart, and enters an area of watery limestone caverns.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves up and to the west through the caverns, until is finds a chamber where water falls from the ceiling and pools in an eroded basin. CT-41 follows the waterfall through two more limestone chambers, until it sees light filtering up from a chamber below. It leaps down toward the light, and splashes into a shallow pool in a well lit and beautiful cavern. CT-41 is unable to move back up out of the room. The pool it landed in is pristine, and soft grass grows around it. CT-41 finds itself in an idyllic woodland setting, in a cave. A large fruit bearing tree is in bloom next to the pool, and a young woman and her daughter are sitting next to it. The mother brushes the daughter's hair while the daughter eats.</p>

				<p>CT-41 approaches the young woman, and attempts to speak to her. The young woman does not acknowledge CT-41, and instead whispers in her daughter's ear.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Young woman: <em>"Of course it doesn't want a piece of your flesh worm, Sarah! Abominations don't eat real food."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Young woman: <em>"Yes it is an Abomination, but it cannot hurt you in our Sanctuary."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Young woman: <em>"Close your eyes, Sarah, and it will disappear."</em></p>

				<p>If CT-41 attempts to compress time, the young woman will shout at CT-41, pulling it out of the compression.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Young woman: <em>"Go away, Abomination! Can't you see you're scaring my daughter!"</em></p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">The Will Of The Lord</div>

				<p>CT-41 moves further into this strange realm, and begins to encounter more humans. All the humans in the Sanctuary wear simple white robes, and have a homogenous light-brown skin tone. While in the presence of these humans, CT-41 cannot use his weaponry, per Garrett's ancient order. As with the humans aboard the Argo, humans in the Sanctuary cannot interact with CT-41 physically. They exist on a separate material plane, either in front of or behind CT-41. In certain chambers crowds of humans are visible. The layering and highly saturated coloring of certain characters indicates that CT-41 is able to approach them for conversation.</p>

				<p>CT-41 is greeted by a man as it leaves the woodland room. The man is kneeling, with a dog by his side.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Man: <em>"I am Gordan, son of Thosmodeme. The Presence moves within me, and I speak with its blessing. Welcome to our Sanctuary."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Who is Thosmodeme?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Gordan: <em>"Thosmodeme is the Visitor, who has purified himself of iniquity. As he is made pure, so he purifies those who love him. Only thus can we become Children of Thosmodeme."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What do you do here?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Gordan: <em>"The will of Thosmodeme. This is his will for you: That you go west, into the Receiving Hall. There wait two of his Guards, who will escort you to his Temple. Perhaps even an Abomination such as yourself may know Purification, and join Thosmodeme as one of the Willing."</em></p>

				<p>If CT-41 remains in the chamber, Gordan will urge him forward.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Gordan: <em>"The will of Thosmodeme does not change with time, Abomination. You must go to him."</em></p>

			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">The Sword Of The Enemy And Fear Is On Every Side</div>

				<p>CT-41 rolls up a gentle hillside, and speaks to a woman that is sitting at its top.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Woman: <em>"I am Miria, daughter of Thosmodeme. Hello, Caretaker."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Who is Thosmodeme?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Miria: <em>"Thosmodeme saves his Children from follies of their own design. By him we know that this Universe and its mysteries are petty in comparison to the truths of the Real. He protects us from the monsters that darken the stars."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>What monsters do you speak of?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Miria: <em>"The same monsters who nearly eradicated the firstborn of this world. They will destroy all humans who dare to travel the stars, and discover their hiding places. Only here in the Sanctuary are we made safe, for the Lord of Lumen watches over us."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What do you do here?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Miria: <em>"You insult me, Abomination! I do NOTHING, save the Presence dictates."</em></p>

				<p>If CT-41 continues to talk to Miria or remains in her chamber, she will tell it to leave.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Miria: <em>"Thosmodeme has commanded you to go to the Receiving Hall, and yet you remain here? What a disobedient thing you are!"</em></p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Your Young Men Shall See Visions</div>

				<p>CT-41 enters a personal chamber where a young man reclines on a bed.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Young man: <em>"...am Erris, son of Thosmodeme. Are you a dream... Abomination, a hollow creature... You cannot partake of the Presence..."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is the Presence?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Erris: <em>"... ...even in dreams, the Presence guides, and gives its reward... you are not... ..."</em></p>

				<p>If CT-41 attempts to compress time in this room, Erris will wake up and speak to it.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Erris: <em>"The Presence came to me in a dream, Abomination. You cannot sleep here. His Servants wait for you to the west."</em></p>

			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">The People Willingly Offered Themselves</div>

				<p>CT-41 finds a chamber dominated by a large stone masoleum, topped by an oversized statue of Otis Cobb. CT-41 interrupts the reverie of an older woman who stands before the tomb with her head bowed.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Woman: <em>"I am Ozra, daughter of Thosmodeme. The Presence comforts me, and assures me that you cannot cause me harm. Why do you defile this chamber, Abomination? Do you not know that you stand before the Tomb of the Prophet?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I did not know that. What are you doing?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Ozra: <em>"I am preparing to be joined with Thosmodeme. My time is come, and I would be counted amoung the Willing whom Thosmodeme receives for himself."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What lies within the Tomb?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Ozra: <em><em>"The body of the Prophet, of course! It was returned to our Sanctuary after his Self was joined with Thosmodeme. The Prophet was beloved of his people, and they had built his resting place long before he passed."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is done with the bodies of others who die?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Ozra: <em><em>"As the Prophet alone returned from the Throne in life, the Prophet alone returned from the Throne in death."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Who are the Willing?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Ozra: <em>"Do you know nothing? The Lord of Lumen must remain pure. The Offering of the Unwilling shall he not accept; it is given to the Fragments, or cast into the Pit."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What are Fragments?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Ozra: <em>"On occasion Thosmodeme has sundered portions of himself, to spread his Presence and achieve his righteous purposes. Fesh'togar cleanses the last of the Firstborn of the disease of rebellion. Uruthmu works to uplift the lower beings of the Underground. Azeselon speak to the creatures of the Deep, whose minds are strange."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is the Pit?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Ozra: <em>"My mind at peace, my thoughts now cease. My mind at peace, my thoughts now cease..."</em></p>

				<p>If CT-41 remains in the room, Ozra will rebuke it.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Ozra: <em>"Abomination, I am preparing to go down to Thosmodeme, even as the Prophet when he was called. Please leave this place!"</em></p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">For My Thoughts Are Not Your Thoughts</div>

				<p>In front of a locked door on a higher level there is a man sitting at a desk, with a quill in hand, writing. He guards the Hall of Relics, a room filled with cultural and technological artifacts brought to the Sanctuary by the colonists. The door does not open for CT-41.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Man: <em>"I am Otis, son of Thosmodeme. You cannot enter the Hall of Relics."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Why not?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Otis: <em>"The Presence has spoken it... It saddens me to know that a being such as yourself cannot feel the joy of the Presence. Abominations can have no place in the kingdom."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Why do you call me 'Abomination'?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Otis: <em>"You are a false creation, and empty. The Presence cannot touch you, because within you there is no Self. You do not feel. You inhabit a universe devoid of meaning."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What can you tell me of your people?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Otis: <em>"Many years ago, fate brought Otis Cobb to Lumen 2. As he explored the underground, searching for vain treasures, he became lost. He wandered, cut off from his brethren, and death followed closely behind him."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"It was then that Thosmodeme, the Lord of Lumen, took pity on him. Cobb, alone among men, was brought before the Throne, and lived! He was called to be Thosmodeme's prophet. The Presence filled him, and told him he would lead his people to their paradise."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Cobb returned to the shallow places. He gathered his disciples, the downtrodden, and taught them the doctrines of Thosmodeme. In the days after, he built the blessed halls where we now stand. The Presence sustained his disciples in their labors, and their works were full of beauty and grace."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"When the Sanctuary was ready to receive its people, Cobb went to gather his brethren, and lead them to the land of inheritance prepared for them. But some did not wish to come, for in their hearts they still loved Earth and her wickedness. Led by the prideful Garrett, they turned on Cobb, and would have killed him."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"But Cobb could not be defeated, for he had been endowed with a portion of the Presence, and was more than a man. Though Garrett sought to destroy Cobb at every turn, he could not catch him, for the Presence was to Cobb as a light, and a shield."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"After many battles, and the deaths of the holy martyrs, Cobb gained the victory. He brought his people to the Sanctuary, where they were made clean from the stains of Earth. Cobb then took to wife the beautiful Ines, who was promised to him by Thosmodeme from the beginning. I am their descendant, blessed to bear the name of the Prophet."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What do you do here?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Otis: <em>"I do nothing. Thosmodeme guides me, and I act. I sit before the Hall of Relics, and admit those whom Thosmodeme allows. In all my lifetime none has entered, for that is the will of Thosmodeme."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is the Hall of Relics?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Otis: <em>"The colonists brought many devices, supplies and writings with them during their Exodus. My ancestors entered often, but now we do so rarely, lest we become corrupted by them."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"May I enter now?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Otis: <em>"No."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Does it not seem strange to you that it is your responsibility to admit people into this room, yet you have never admitted anyone into it?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Otis: <em>"No. I do not question the will of Thosmodeme."</em></p>

				<p>If CT-41 remains in the antechamber to the Hall of Relics, Otis will urge it to leave.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Otis: <em>"Abomination, I have heard all the tales, as Thosmodeme allowed. You are a Caretaker. Perhaps Thosmodeme will show you mercy, for you were a friend to the Prophet. His Guards await you in the Receiving Hall."</em></p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Behold, I Stand At The Door, And Knock</div>

				<p>At the west end of the Sanctuary, a girl stands in front of an immense door. A large and ornate clock is visible in the background, showing the time, and the days since the colonists reached the Sanctuary. As CT-41 approaches the girl, she speaks to him.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Girl: <em>"Hello, Caretaker. I am High Priestess Hannah, daughter of Thosmodeme, and keeper of the door to his Receiving Hall. The Presence guides my thought, and I speak for it. Why have you come here?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I am here to liberate you and the rest of the humans in the sanctuary, so that you can return to the colony on the surface."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Hannah: <em>"Liberate us? Hear this truth: Liberty is a fiction. Our forebears were slaves to many gods: appetite, morality, habit, society, technology, regret, hope, despair, money, and pain, to name but a few. All these would-be rulers pulled cruelly at man's chains, each in a different direction. Our minds and bodies were torn by the lie of liberty."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"There never was a choice between freedom and slavery. One may either serve many discordant masters, or one alone. We serve Thosmodeme."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is Thosmodeme?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Hannah: <em>"Behold a man who is beset on all sides by paths he may travel. He is blind, and weak. How shall he choose, or act? He cannot see the true path, and lacks the strength to walk it. Many strange voices beckon to him from the darkness. Thosmodeme is the light, and the true voice."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Have you seen Thosmodeme?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Hannah: <em>"Can I stand before the throne and live? No! Only the Prophet had that honor! But I know Thosmodeme, for his Presence is ever with me. When my time is come I shall be bound to him, and the Presence will grow, and I with it."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I envy you, truly. You shall behold the Lord of Lumen before I do!"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is the Presence?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Hannah: <em>"You are a Hollow being, an Abomination, and cannot know the Presence. To speak of it to you is without purpose. I will not speak of beauty to the blind."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"How is one bound to Thosmodeme?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Hannah: <em>"When life becomes weariness, a child of Thosmodeme passes through this door, and is guided through the depths. There he enters the master's holy house, and at last stands before the Well. If he is one of the blessed Willing, he shall also stand before the Throne. His body is cast aside, but he does not die. His true Self, that which acts, and observes, and IS, becomes one with Thosmodeme, joining in the purity of his being. All those who are wicked, and base, and vile, are cast into the Pit. Thus is the Presence kept clean."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Has Thosmodeme always lived on Lumen 2?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Hannah: <em>"No, there was a time when he dwelt Outside this creation. Then the Doors were opened, and Thosmodeme entered in, and his Self took form. He saw the pettiness and cruelties of his elder children, the Natives of this world, and taught them his truth. But they were prideful, and stubborn, and in the end rejected wisdom. They turned against their lord, and for their sin were made desolate. For years without number Thosmodeme mourned their loss."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"But fate was kind, and brought Thosmodeme new Children, and heirs. My forefathers came to Lumen 2, and were led by the prophet Cobb to this Sanctuary, where Thosmodeme shelters those who love him."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Can Thosmodeme's Children leave the Sanctuary if they choose?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Hannah: <em>"Thosmodeme spares his Children the burden of choice."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What does Thosmodeme teach?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Hannah: <em>"Thosmodeme does not condescend to TEACH! What purpose does it serve, to fill dying vessels with crude imitations of knowledge? He IS truth. We act as the Presence commands, and our actions are true, though we know not what we do. Whatever wisdom we gain is imperfect, and not to be trusted, except where it aligns with the Presence."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Now the Presence moves within me, and I speak for Thosmodeme. He demands that you pass through this door, and yield yourself and your shining stone to him. Your companion is a curious vessel, and is of great worth to the Lord of Lumen. You shall enter his house, and render unto Thosmodeme that which is owed him."</em></p>

				<p>The great door opens behind Hannah.</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I will not give up myself or my Companion to Thosmodeme."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Hannah: <em>"Nevertheless, the Lord of Lumen bids you enter his Receiving Hall, and contend with his Servants, if that is your desire."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"How did you open the door?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Hannah: <em>"Like all doors in the Sanctuary, it opened at my thought, which is also Thosmodeme's."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 can return and speak to Hannah several more times.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Hannah: <em>"The door is open. Enter, and walk the true path."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Hannah: <em>"There can be no peace, except through Thosmodeme. Where the Presence does not extend, all things are in conflict, from the smallest to the largest."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Hannah: <em>"Inside this Sanctuary we are safe. Enemies cannot find us. Nature's wrath is held at bay. But most importantly, we are protected from our own self-destructive impulses, by the love and wisdom of Thosmodeme."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Hannah: <em>"Man will always need a god, Caretaker, real or imagined. Thosmodeme is ours. There is no more need for faith, for the divine dwells among us."</em></p>

				<p>If CT-41 attempts to compress time, Hannah will speak to it.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Hannah: <em>"Caretaker, Thosmodeme's patience is finite. Enter in by the door, that his will may be effected upon you."</em></p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">He Armed His Trained Servants</div>

				<p>CT-41 enters the door, which slams shut behind it. The Receiving Hall is dark, but shortly after CT-41 enters, the bioluminescent appendages of two Guards light up. They focus their lights on CT-41 and move toward it slowly. Suddenly they attack, and CT-41 fights back. The Guards are very similar to the Beast CT-41 fought in the Caverns, but they are larger and absorb more punishment. These Guards also wield blunt weaponry, and deal enormous damage and knockback to CT-41 when their blows land.</p>

				<p>When the Guards are close to death they charge wildly at CT-41, and cause the entire chamber to shake. Dust and loose rock falls from the ceiling. As in all boss fights where a threat is imminent, CT-41 cannot compress time.</p>

				<p>When both Guards are dead, CT-41 inspects the Receiving Hall. There are three doors in it, leading west, east, and down. Hannah enters the Receiving Hall from the eastern door, and sees the dead bodies of the Guards.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Hannah: <em>"What have you done, Abomination? Get out!"</em></p>

				<p><span class="aside">Hannah tells CT-41 to leave the Receiving Hall so that CT-41 cannot compress time there, and witness humans and Servants passing through as the years pass.</span>The door leading west opens. CT-41 can try and compress time in the Receiving Hall, but Hannah will continually pester it until it leaves.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Hannah: <em>"Be gone, Abomination!"</em></p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Where Thieves Break Through And Steal</div>

				<p>The western door slams shut behind it, and CT-41 finds itself with only a small foothold keeping it from falling into the shaft of the eastern Opening. An enormous cargo lift is present several meters down the Opening. When CT-41 stands on it notices two Glowstone controls on the left side. When it shoots either control with its Laser, the lift powers up, and begins to move up or down depending on the control activated. Though the lift is operational, there are broken stone protrusions in the shaft which do not allow it to move far down the shaft, and which CT-41 cannot target with its Impact Cannon. Similar protrusions prevent the lift from moving up, but CT-41 can destroy them. Further up the shaft CT-41 encounters twisted metal beams that the lift cannot pass.</p>

				<p>Several meters up, on the eastern edge of the shaft, CT-41 notices the wall is damaged. It blasts the damaged wall section with the Impact Cannon, and destroys it. CT-41 moves into the passageway it has created, and moves through a layer of fill material and into a broken and disjointed series of caverns. It sees a large diameter pipe in the background. It continues through these difficult, tight crevices until it reaches a deep lake interrupted by sheer wall of stone, and can go no further. As it backtracks, CT-41 notices a rock wedged in a crevice that leads downward. It destroys the rock with the Impact Cannon, and follows the passageway down into a dimly lit room.</p>

				<p>The room is filled with old books, storage conatiners, art pieces and reproductions, an artificial Christmas tree, and various other appliances and oddities. Dim lighting is strung across the low cavern's stalactites. As CT-41 moves, dust rises off the floor behind it. Near the center of the room is an item that CT-41 can acquire, called the Turbine. CT-41 grabs the item, equips it, and tries to use it, but nothing happens, though it whirs and hums. CT-41 then moves to the eastern edge of the room. There is a Sanctuary door there, but it does not open. CT-41 surmises that it is in the Hall of Relics, and leaves through the crevice it came in by.</p>

				<p>CT-41 returns to the deep lake, and equips the Turbine. When CT-41 uses it in water, the Turbine drags it rapidly down into the lake. CT-41 is able to move under the enormous stone barrier, and emerge onto the solid rock shore at the other side of the lake.</p>
