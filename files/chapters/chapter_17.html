				<p>After finding the Turbine in the Hall of Relics, CT-41 returns to the Sea seeking new avenues for exploration. It moves down into the waters, and even a few meters below the surface finds the waters darker and more opaque. Although the Flashlight has served it well in the past, it is less useful here in the murky depths. CT-41 finds that its Lasers have better penetrating power, and can help it to define the outlines of Sea's features.</p>

				<p>CT-41 encounters a variety of exotic lifeforms in the Sea; bottom feeders, aggressive hunters, schooling organisms, vegetative life, bioluminescing organisms, and spiny lifeforms are all present. Some creatures impale prey with violently ejected barbs, other release toxic bubbles that move upward, killing prey that then falls to the seabed. Certain weedlike growths tangle and slow CT-41 as it passes through them. Here in the deep waters life is more varied and abundant than anywhere CT-41 has explored so far.</p>

				<p>CT-41 descends to the Abyssal Trench, but finds it impossible to navigate due to #OBSTACLE. Undeterred in its exploration, CT-41 moves eastward along the seafloor, and eventally finds a capsized Native vessel. Heavy containers are strewn about in the vicinity of the Sunken Ship, which is covered in aquatic life. CT-41 clears plant-like growths from the surface of the vessel to expose a door. CT-41 uses the Volt Gun on exposed wiring to power the door, and enters a pump chamber. CT-41 uses the Volt Gun to pump the water from the chamber, before entering the main body of the Sunken Ship.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves through the Sunken Ship, and eventually arrives at a section of the ship which is mostly flooded with water. There is a noticeable opening in the hull of the vessel, and CT-41 surmises that this hole was the cause of the capsize. CT-41 notices significant damage to the interior of the vessel. It finds the bodies of several Lumene Natives, mutilated almost beyond recognition. Deep in the flooded compartments CT-41 finds and defeats a Hydra, ostensibly the being responsible for the capsize. In the chambers beyond the Hydra, CT-41 finds a sealed room containing several Material vials, and greatly improves its Native weaponry.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves back above the water level within the Ship, and finds a section of the vessel has been submerged in loose sediment. CT-41 blasts through the sediments that have filled some of the vessels crawlspaces, and finds a passageway out of the vessel leading downward. The caverns below the Wreck are damp, and have frequent pools, but most are not completely flooded.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">The Degenerate Plant Of A Strange Vine</div>
				<!--
				for his root was by great waters
				a root that beareth gall and wormwood
				their root shall be as rottenness
				out of the serpent's root
				leave the stump of his roots in the earth
				leave them neither root nor branch
				the root of all evil
				the degenerate plant of a strange vine
				-->

				<p>CT-41 moves through the silty and damp caverns of the Womb. For many Turns these caverns had been preserved in a nearly natural state by Native conservationists, and other than occasional lighting and carved perches, the Womb is undisturbed. The primordial pools glow with the presence of microbial life, and shimmer as CT-41 moves through them. The rocks of the Womb glisten and shift in color, covered in water and matted growths. Water drips constantly from stalactites on the cavern ceilings, as the Sea filters downward through the crust, and sends ripples across the surface of the waters.</p>

				<p>As CT-41 moves down, it encounters larger creatures in the Womb, Servants of Thosmodeme. It sees many fetal forms of larger creatures, including Guards and Dragons. It also sees dark tendrils similar to Deep Roots growing up into the Pools. These Dark Roots feed the developing Servants of Thosmodeme, and are uniquitous in the birthing chambers. At the junctions between caverns CT-41 encounters several Dark Overgrowths, and defeats them to gain passage. Throughout the Womb are several crude statues and structures, formed as if by a burgeoning but incomplete intelligence.</p>

				<p>In the lower chambers of the Womb, nearer to the Magma Chambers, steam rises from the surface of the pools. In this area of warm pools, CT-41 enters a chamber dominated by an island filled by the Dark Origin. The Dark Origin is a mass of many glowing, pulsating fluid filled bulbs, connected via a large Deep Root vine to the Deep Roots of the Farmland. Its tendrils branch upward into the caverns above, sustaining the Dark Roots and Dark Overgrowths of the Womb. From the water CT-41 must destroy the Dark Origin, blasting apart its bulbs and exposing its neural center, all while avoiding attacks from its tendrils above and below the water. Once the Dark Origin is destroyed and withered, CT-41 can continue across its chamber, and enter into the Sanctum of Uruthmu.</p>

			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">The Angel Of The Waters</div>
				<!--
				the depths were congealed
				dark waters, and thick clouds
				I have healed these waters
				So the waters were healed
				Terrors take hold on him as waters
				dark waters and thick clouds
				the waters thereof roar
				He gathereth the waters
				the waters shall be healed
				the angel of the waters
				-->

				<p>After it destroys the Dark Origin, CT-41 hears and feels a distant ground-shaking howl that causes the water to tremble and the cave walls to shake. CT-41 moves up and to the west, across the depths of the Abyssal Trench and into the Sanctum of Uruthmu. From this point on CT-41 only encounters insignificant lifeforms, and Krakens, within the Womb.</p>

				<p>Krakens are apex aquatic lifeforms, of the Draconid family, and have been chosen as Uruthmu to protect his Sanctum. They possess cruely barbed tentacles, with which they lash out at CT-41 from great distance. CT-41 destroys several of the creatures as it maneuvers through the Sanctum.</p>

				<p>The area that Uruthmu has called his Sanctum was once a holy site, frequented by reverent Natives. Its pathways and lighting are more obvious than in the conservation areas of the Womb. In a hidden chamber off the beaten path CT-41 discovers a pristine pool. At the center of the pool is a shrine, similar to the ones in the Ancestral Halls, where a statue has been carved in the shape of a Laborer. This shrine is smaller and less skillfully formed than the others CT-41 saw earlier.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves into an area of deep, dark water near the Abyssal Trench, and begins moving through a mazelike and porous region with many different possible pathways. In spite of the darkness the area is peaceful and contemplative. CT-41 moves boulders and moves through the soft currents of the region, and finally breaks through into trench leading upward. Angelic light filters through the water from above, and CT-41 ascends.</p>

				<p>CT-41 emerges from the trench in a large pool full of light, illuminated by billions of microorganisms. Huge stalactites hang from the ceiling, and the floor is a silty clay, ostensibly composed of layers and layers of miniscule dead lifeforms. CT-41 inspects the cavern, and to the west finds a short submerged passage, leading to a strange, living door that it cannot open or destroy.</p>

				<p>CT-41 can try to leave the chamber by heading back down into the trench, but is gently and irresistably pulled back up by the current. The lights of the pool begin to coalesce into cloudy shape and pulse, dealing damage to CT-41 if it touches them. CT-41 moves away from the swarms, and the shadow of an otherworldly being appears in the water. If CT-41 is in the water it will be pulled toward the being. If it reaches the being, it will take enormous damage from direct attacks.</p>

				<p>This Fragment of Thosmodeme, called 'Uruthmu', or the Spirit of Water by humans in the Sanctuary, attacks CT-41 with radial shockwaves sent through the water, with its swarming hosts of microbes, and with direct attacks when it takes physical form. Once Uruthmu starts using its shockwave attacks, large stalactites from the cavern roof will fall into the pool and lodge in its sediments. These stalactites may get in CT-41's way, but will also allow it easier access to air. Once Uruthmu has taken sufficient damage, it will cause all of its microbes to simultaneously darken, leaving CT-41 with only its own light to see. During this darkness, the waters will part on either side of CT-41, and Uruthmu will appear above it, striking down with devastating physical blows.</p>

				<p>If CT-41 weathers Uruthmu's storms and deals sufficient damage, the Spirit of Water will decohere, and be drawn into the Necrolith. With Uruthmu captured, CT-41 is able to move to the Sentinel door, which now opens with its master no longer forbidding access. CT-41 passes west through the Sentinel's slimy, tubular body, and eventually reaches a second opening. CT-41 passes through, and finds itself in a control and electronics chamber at the upper eastern edge of the Assembly Hall. There CT-41 finds a vial of Quantum Spin Liquid, which allows Kozlov's Toy to produce a Stop beam. A Stop beam freezes a target in time, rendering it immune to all movement and status effects.</p>

				<p>CT-41 then moves back through the Sentinel door, and moves down another internal passageway to opening that deposits it in the eastern half of the Highway. From this point on, CT-41 can return to the Womb via this passageway, in addition to descending through the Sea and the Wreck.</p>

			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Arise, Devour Much Flesh</div>

				<p>After defeating Uruthmu and returning to the Highway, CT-41 moves to the Flesh Vats, a facility built by the Farmers and Engineers but maintained by the Warriors. The Flesh Vats are large basins and vats where aquatic creatures and fleshy tissues were bred and cultured. 
				</p>

				<p>In a crevice between two flesh vats CT-41 finds the pitiful remains of a Native, smaller than other Native remains it has encountered. The Companion enters CT-41's mind, and speaks.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"This Laborer died here, but his body was never found, or defiled... His Seed is intact, and we should be able to speak to him. His speech will be a simplified form of Standard Lumene. Depending on this Laborer's development, his grammar and vocabulary may be limited. I will translate as faithfully, yet intelligibly, as I can."</p></em>

				<div class="entry-section-title">The Labourer Is Worthy Of His Reward</div>
				<!--
				Laborers express and act, but do not ask questions(?)
				-->

				<p>CT-41 moves toward the Laborer, and attempts to talk to it.</p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Hello, Laborer."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Laborer: <em>"..."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Hello?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Laborer: <em>"....."</em></p>


				<p>CT-41 moves away from the unresponsive Laborer. If it returns to speak to the Laborer again, CT-41 will be able to communicate with it.</p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Hello, Laborer. Please speak to me, I am a friend."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Laborer: <em>".......Dark."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Are you in the dark?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Laborer: <em>"Dark sleep, now new lights."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What are the new lights?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Laborer: <em>"New lights again. Where old lights?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What are the old lights?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Laborer: <em>"Still new lights. Old lights brighter, stronger. New lights not Old God voice. New lights ask, do not command."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I am CT-41, a Caretaker automaton. I am the new voice in your mind. One of your Kinsmen is helping to translate my thoughts, so that you can understand them."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Laborer: <em>"New lights are Abomination! Hate Caretaker enemy!"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I do not hate you, Laborer, and I would like to keep speaking to you. What can you tell me about the old lights?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Laborer: <em>"..."</em></p>


				<p>The Laborer refuses to speak to CT-41, for now. CT-41 can return to the Laborer, and attempt to speak again.</p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Tell me about the old lights."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Laborer: <em>"......"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Tell me about the old lights, NOW!"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Laborer: <em>"...Old lights from Old God. In old time we obey Old God. Then he gives food. Old God goes away for long time, but returns. We do what he commands. Where old lights?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I do not know. What did the Old God command?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Laborer: <em>"...Ha! Bad Caretaker Abomination not know Old God. Not seen old lights! Caretaker is false, and weak! We don't obey."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Tell me what the Old God commanded you to do!"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Laborer: <em>"...Abomination is angry, and powerful! I am afraid... Where old lights? Where Old God go? Why alone?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"For the last time, TELL ME WHAT THE OLD GOD COMMANDED YOU TO DO!"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Laborer: <em>"...Bad Rulers were greedy, and cruel. They kept good things hidden, for themselves. Bad Rulers would not remember Old God. They shamed Explorer, and used Laborer."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Old God gave Laborers smart thoughts, we made good things and homes like others. The Old God said dig, and build with pretty stone. We made pretty house for Old God. His lights guided us. We finished house, but the bad Rulers were always greedy, and still kept the good things hidden. Not let us be great..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Old God said dig secret tunnel. Hot water punished bad Rulers, and Old God happy. We felt happiness too."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Tell me, Laborer, what happened after the Rulers were punished?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Laborer: <em>"Not 'Laborer'! We Builders now, good Lineage, not low people. We build Old God's kingdom. We go secret places, and do great things.

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Healers happy now, like Builders. All good Lineages obey the smart thoughts from Old God all the time. The bad thoughts are Purified, like the bad Rulers."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What did you do after the Old God returned?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Builder: <em>"I do what smart thoughts said. Not smart before, but smart thoughts from Old God made us like others. I help build Old God house. I help dig tunnel to punish bad Rulers. I help bring runaway bad Rulers to Old God's house."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Builder: <em>"No, that bad. We can go his house, but not enter his room. Only after bad thoughts Purify we go to room..."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"How are bad thoughts Purified?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Builder: <em>"Old God gives good thoughts and smart thoughts to Children. We accept good thoughts and do good things and have happy feelings. But sometimes a bad Child not accept good thoughts."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Bad Child goes Old God's house, so close to Old God. In quiet rooms bad Child not distracted by strange lights and noisy thoughts. Old God speaks good thoughts, again and again, always until change. Good thoughts stay, bad thoughts leave."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is the Blessing?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Builder: <em>"Blessing is final gift of Old God. He gives Blessing to all good Children. To receive Blessing, good Child goes to Old God, and joins him in happiness forever."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Do you wish to receive the Blessing?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Builder: <em>"Of course, but not yet! Child can only receive Blessing when body old, and enters Old God's room. I am still young, and not Purified. I am not ready to die."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"But... You are dead, Builder."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Builder: <em>"No, I am not. Just moments ago old lights brought me here, to work flesh vats."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What happened next?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Builder: <em>"I stirred vats... I watched hot lights... Then I did not know what to do, because no more smart thoughts came. I could not see Old God.

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I am currently speaking to you Seed, but your body has withered away. You died a very long time ago."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I do not know what you will do, but I can offer you a new life. My Companion can empower your Seed, to join me in my journey and aid me in my battles. You will see hidden places, and receive much knowledge."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Then you will join me?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Builder: <em>"Yes."</em></p>

				<p>The Builder's Seed glows a bright orange, and rises from the ground. It follows the Companion, more erratically than any of the other Seeds. The Necrolith gains the ability to #POWER. Soon after it is empowered, the Builder speaks to CT-41.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Builder: <em>"I see real lights again! How?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"You are seeing the world through my eyes."</em></p>
