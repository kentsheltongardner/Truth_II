				<p>After Voronash finishes consuming Thosmodeme, he turns toward CT-41, eager to crack open the Necrolith and consume the Fragments bound inside it. As Voronash approaches, CT-41 hears a disturbing noise, whose volume is based on its proximity to Voronash. Ambiental noises and music recede as Voronash draws closer. Though CT-41 is powerful, it is not yet a match for Voronash, and must flee or be destroyed. The main entrance to the Throneroom is still shut, and CT-41 cannot move up into the Well of Offering. With only one remaining avenue for escape, CT-41 enters the tunnel through which Voronash burst into the Throneroom.</p>

				<p>After entering the tunnel, CT-41 looks for a hiding place, with Voronash pursuing close behind. CT-41 speeds through the twisted and cracked lower crust, through the ancient and unsettled caverns at the base of the Labyrinth. These caverns are composed of enormous slabs of shattered stone, gaping fissures, and are clearly the result of geological forces rather than erosion or design.</p>

				<p>Though it doesn't have time to pay close attention to its surroundings, CT-41 does notice that life in the Labyrinth is very different from in the Basin or the Farmlands. The heat here is intense, and plants and animals here are completely different from those to the east.</p>

				<p>CT-41 thinks it has escaped from Voronash several times, only to see the Devouring Spirit emerge and continue its pursuit. Only when CT-41  passes into the Worshippers' Catacombs is it finally safe. The narrow passageways where the Worshippers entombed themselves are too small for Voronash to enter. CT-41 curls up against the tortured bodies of the dead Worshippers while hiding from Voronash, and the Outsider speaks once the throbbing rumble and whine of Voronash's presence begins to recede.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"You are safe for now, Caretaker. Voronash cannot follow us here. But he will not be idle, and you will know of his doings before long."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 is now free to explore the new region it has discovered. Within the Catacombs CT-41 witnesses the last remnants of a long forgotten Lumene Native civilization, that worshipped the Underworld and the warmth that emanated from it. At the end of each tunnel in the Catacombs are the shriveled remains of a Lumene Native, including his Seed. As CT-41 moves through the Catacombs, the Outsider speaks again.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"I do not know this place, CT-41, but the Devouring Spirit dwelt here once."</em>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Before the Tyrant and the Devouring Spirit found their natures to be irreconciliable within Creation, the Singularity was one... It fled to these Catacombs, to escape the commotion and confusion of the Realm."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I believe that the Singularity first learned how to touch the minds of my people as it peered into the Seeds scattered throughout these strange tombs."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"These Seeds are ancient, Caretaker, far more ancient even than I am. I cannot empower them to join us, but they may still contain some fragments of thought, guarded jealously until the end."</em></p>

				<p>The Outsider translates the thoughts of several of the Seeds for CT-41. As it does so, CT-41 hears the sonorous and resonant noises of the Magma Worms speaking to each other in the Underworld. The eternal voices grow louder and deeper in the Catacombs, as CT-41 draws nearer to the concavity at the base of the Volcano.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Corrupted Seed: <em>"Before I die, tell me, great Gods, why are we punished? What is our sin?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Corrupted Seed: <em>[I will see the inside of all flesh, and know that it is empty.]</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Corrupted Seed: <em>"I have called out to the Gods in the Underworld, but they do not hear me, no matter how near I draw to them... Their songs are unchanging, in spite of my supplication..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Corrupted Seed: <em>[All things end in darkness. There is no sin like that which is preordained.]</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Corrupted Seed: <em>"Great Gods, the Doom is my cursed birthright... My children shall inherit my fate also, unless you intervene... I offer myself to the Underworld, that they might be spared."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Corrupted Seed: <em>[It bulges and bursts. As it dies I take pleasure, for its lie dies with it.]</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Corrupted Seed: <em>"Gods, my Seed is defiled, and my thoughts are broken... The Doom now takes me... [I will cut the Seed from its body, and delight as it thrashes stupidly.] They bind me to the walls, to save me from my madness... Soon the Doom will consume me utterly. I come to you freely, while I am still myself."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Corrupted Seed: <em>[I am alone, and there is none that watches me.]</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Corrupted Seed: <em>"The death of the mind is death indeed, and I have felt my own. When I die there remains only a rage that would destroy the world, if it could. Great Gods of the Underworld, take me now, before the Doom."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Corrupted Seed: <em>[Its insides splatter across the cavern, and for a moment I am God.]</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Corrupted Seed: <em>"Upon each generation our disease comes more quickly. Soon the Doom shall claim our children while they are still young, before they can bear children of their own... Is our extinction justice? If you will not hear my pleas, then at least pay heed to my death, great Gods of the Underworld!"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Corrupted Seed: <em>[The lie that I am ends now.]</em></p>

				<p>After peering into the Worshippers' Doomed Seeds, CT-41 moves away from the Catacombs, and back into the Labyrinth.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">The Pit Wherein Is No Water</div>

				<p>As CT-41 explores deeper into the crust from the Catacombs it discovers a chamber containing the mutilated remains of two Temple Guards. The bodies are on either side of an enormous and cracked sarcophogal stone that once sealed the opening to a Pit. CT-41 falls into the opening, and finds itself in a dark but incredibly hot cavern. On the walls of the Pit are gouged many strange markings. The language of the markings is foreign to CT-41.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"This is the Pit where the Devouring Spirit was once bound by the Tyrant. In life he forbade me to come here."</em>

				<p>If CT-41 has the Linguist as a Companion, the Outsider offers to translate the markings.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"Our Linguist has translated the inscriptions on the walls. They read thus:"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Glyphs: <em>
					<br/>"Clever fool who reads these signs: I studied the writing on Creation's Walls.
					<br/>You see what I leave behind: I know where your broken body lies.
					<br/>Truth is oldest, and knows no end: You have died ten thousand times.
					<br/>I was captive for an age: Only I am still alive."</em></p>

				<p>Among the etchings are several pictographs, including a depiction of a robot similar to CT-41, and an unknown spacefaring vessel set among the stars. Once it has absorbed all it can of the Pit, CT-41 returns to the opening through which a soft light shines, and leaves.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">That Which Decayeth And Waxeth Old</div>

				<p>CT-41 returns to the Catacombs, and moves upward. It begins to see ruins, much more ancient than those it found in the Excavation. These Lower Ruins are entirely overrun by strange plants and creatures, and many of the carved stones here are so old that they crumble under CT-41's weight. CT-41 moves through the once beautiful open spaces of the Lower Ruins, where strange growths hang from arches and columns. The Lower Ruins are clearly the product of an intelligent and enterprising people, but the only clue about their fate comes from the Seeds of the maddened and suicidal Worshippers in the Catacombs.</p>

				<p>Within the Ruins CT-41 sees Silicate growths, delicate white crystalline lifeforms, which were clearly cultivated by the Worshippers. Many have begun to overgrow their ornate latticeworks, or burst out of their glass domes and cylinders. If CT-41 touches the incredibly sharp Silicates it will take significant damage. CT-41 can destroy these Silicates, but laser weaponry simply refracts through them.</p>

				<p>Throughout the Lower Ruins and the Labyrinth, CT-41 encounters yellow-tinged pools with high concentrations of corrosive agents. The water in these pools deals heavy damage to CT-41. These toxic pools are the result of lazy chemical waste management in the Chemical Disposal Area. CT-41 must avoid exposure to these pools at all cost.</p>

				<p>The upper western quadrant of the Lower Ruins show evidence of widespread fire damage, and are dotted with the burnt remains of many mid-sized Natives. CT-41 finds one mound of dead Worshippers, all huddled together in an ash heap.</p>

			</div>

				<div class="entry-section-title">The Terrible Crystal, Stretched Forth Over Their Heads</div>

				<p>CT-41 moves up out of the Lower Ruins, and comes to a fork in the caverns, with one passage leading east and the other west. CT-41 moves west, and after passing over and through several toxic pools, begins to see wild Silicate growths. In this passage normal Lumene life has had difficulty adapting to the presence of seeping industrial waste, but the hardy Silicates are undeterred in their growth.</p>

				<p>As CT-41 draws closer to the base of the Volcano, the size of the Silicates increases, and CT-41 begins to hear the high drone of their singing. The Silicates here are territorial, and will attack CT-41 with laser attacks. When larger Silicates are destroyed, they shatter violently, blasting damaging shards through their chambers.</p>

				<p>As the heat increases, and the singing of the Silicates grows polyphonous and complex, CT-41 falls into and is trapped in the chamber of the Crystal King, an enormous Silicate growth that covers all the walls of its abode. Lasers fire from all directions at CT-41, who must blast portions of the Crystal King away in order to have ground to stand on. CT-41 avoids the Crystal Kings attacks, while damaging the layers of growth that protect its core. Once CT-41 destroys the core, its death reveals a pathway into a chamber below, and a large crystal at the center of the King falls away. CT-41 enters the subchamber, and takes the crystal. The Nanite Colony adapts it into the Photon Crystal, increasing CT-41's battery capacity, and CT-41 returns to the crossroads to the east.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">He Hath Defiled The Sanctuary</div>

				<p>As CT-41 moves east from the fork, it finds an item and some other Native gear near the shore of the first toxic pool an Explorer might have encountered as it left the Whispering Caves. The Nanite Colony analyzes and adapts the item, and CT-41 receives and equips the Corner Cutter. In order to enter the Whispering Caves, CT-41 must use the Corner Cutter to destroy several Hoplites that would have otherwise prevented its passage.</p>

				<p>Once it is in the Whispering Caves, CT-41 returns to the Sanctuary. It discovers that the entrances at both ends of the Sanctuary have been torn open. CT-41 does not see any of Thosmodeme's Children, and the Sanctuary is in disarray. The crops are trampled, the animals are gone, and the pools are foul and muddied. The Tomb of the Prophet is broken open, but CT-41 finds nothing inside but bones.</p>

				<p>CT-41 finds an engraving in the trunk of the largest tree in the Sanctuary.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Scroll: <em>
					<br/>"We Children of Thosmodeme tremble, for
					<br/>The Presence has withdrawn, and
					<br/>Strange thoughts come to us, as
					<br/>Voices of forgetfulness and betrayal.
					<br/>
					<br/>Yet Voronash lies bound in the Pit, while
					<br/>Thosmodeme reigns over all the world.
					<br/>
					<br/>Thus we cling to the Light of Lumen,
					<br/>And cast out the visions of darkness,
					<br/>For we know the Presence will return,
					<br/>To join us again with our Father."</em></p>
