				<div class="entry-section-title">The Doors Were Shut</div>

				<p>CT-41 leaves the strangeness of the Isolation Wing, passing through the heavy doors that seal its otherworldly inhabitants within. It moves back up and west through the Rulers' Locus, toward the vertical shaft that joins the Basin and the Refuge. CT-41 reaches the surface of the floodwaters, and begins to work its way upward. Although the lift at the base of the shaft is inoperable, CT-41 is able to climb growths that line the walls until it reaches a Locus Door leading to the Healing Pools and the Highway. Instead of continuing upward, however, CT-41 explores a shaft, leading westward, that is very similar to the paths found in the ancient sections of the Fortress.</p>

				<p>As CT-41 follows the path it reaches several dead ends, but eventually moves down into a large, overgrown residential region. CT-41 notices several distinguishing features of the area, once called the Holy City. The stone used here is clearly imported from the Quarry. Huge slabs of quality rock act as foundations and walls in an area whose natural stone and soil are unstable. The slabs were placed well, but some have begun to shift and tilt, as a result of erosion and seismic activity.</p>

				<p>The high technology of the Native Realm is nowhere present. There are no Terminals, no artificial lights, no pumps or fans or other machinery. Thorny growths have wedged themselves firmly into the cracks and joints between simply decorated stones. Vegetation chokes the handsome statues and pedastals of the region, and fill the communal pools between small Native habitations. Tainted water trickles down along broken aqueducts, and territorial creatures lash out at CT-41 as it disturbs the region's familiar and ancient patterns of life. In spite of its antiquated technology, the Holy City is vast, and is the largest Native population center that CT-41 explores during its journey.</p>

				<p>CT-41 finds a tunnel leading west out of this Residential Sector, but a hitherto unknown breed of Sentinel prevents its passage through the corridor, and attacks CT-41 if it gets too close. CT-41 moves back into the overgrown urban district, and discovers another, more rambling path leading down. CT-41 follows the path, and arrives at a network of caves, each containing a pool filled with murky water. Within the water CT-41 spots the dull, pulsing glow of various aquatic lifeforms, predator and prey. Though the general structure of these chambers has not been altered, there is plenty of evidence for the action of intelligent agents. Floating in the pools, or sunken under water and silt, are various watercraft, growth lattices, nets, sieves, and baskets.</p>

				<p>At the western end of the Feeding Pools CT-41 finds a regular staircase leading upward, and it enters the crude water channels and basins of a new and very large structure. CT-41 moves through filthy tunnels that carry sullied waters, and past eroded or rusted sluices and grates. The perfectly cut stones it sees here are enormous, even larger than those it saw in the Residential Sector. CT-41 moves up and out of the drainage system, and finds itself in the lower floors of a huge and ornate religious complex.</p>

				<p>Like other areas of the Holy City, the native rock that bears the Temple's stone is porous and crumbling, but great care has been taken through the ages to keep eroded or collapsing pockets beneath stones filled. Wrought iron adornments and structural elements contrast with the stone. Glowstone orbs hang from the ceilings and peek out of the floors. As CT-41 lights the Glowstone fixtures they absorb its light, and slowly disspate it back into the world, softly illuminating the halls of the Temple, and casting eerie shadows.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves west through increasingly ornate rooms and passages of the Temple, and up several flights of stairs, until it enters the Antechamber. At the western end of the room is a Wyvern, the first of the Temple's three Draconid Guardians. It is larger than the Wyverns CT-41 encountered in the Whispering Caves, its body is protected by crudely wrought iron plates, and its entire body pulses with a strange light that filters through its translucent flesh. CT-41 approaches the Guardian, which rises to meet it.</p>

				<p>The Wyvern takes to the air after being attacked by CT-41, and uses the high ceiling of the Antechamber to its advantage. It perches on enormous statues, firing its powerful Draconid laser at CT-41 from a distance, while occasionally swooping down to lash out at its foe. CT-41 analyzes the attack patterns of the Wyvern, and works to destroy its armor using the Resonator. Though keeping the Resonator trained on the Wyvern is difficult, CT-41 can deal much higher damage to its enemy once the armor is destroyed.</p>

				<p>After a grueling battle, CT-41 defeats the Guardian, which falls heavily to the ground. A powerful Fragment is drawn out of it and into the Necrolith, increasing its available energy. CT-41 moves to the western end of the Antechamber, and stands before the enormous Penitent's Door, made of monolithic stone and wrought iron. The colossal Door does not yield to the simple entreaty of CT-41's presence, and the enterprising robot must seek a new route toward Thosmodeme.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Where Your Treasure Is</div>

				<p>CT-41 moves back out of the Antechamber, and begins to explore up the eastern half of the Temple. It fights its way through many iron-clawed and armored Servants that partol the upper levels of the Temple, including armored Temple Guards, and eventually reaches a huge multi-tiered ampitheatre. At the center of the ampitheatre is a tall, winding stone pillar, topped by a slightly wider stone platform. The length of the pillar is carved in the shape of many Lumene Natives, all clawing toward the top, and some whose appendages reach onto the top of the platform. CT-41 observes this curiosity, and continues upward.</p>

				<p>Eventually CT-41 arrives at the top eastern portion of the Temple, where it finds Sentinels guarding passageways east and up. Unable to advance, CT-41 turns back, and begins a more careful examination of the center of the Temple.</p>

				<p>As CT-41 pokes around the ornate chambers at the heart of the Temple, it notices occasional iron vents, and sees many statues of Lumene creatures higher up on the walls. Some of the statues hold Glowstone orbs, others let water fall into pools and channels, and others still breathe fresh air into musty rooms. Unbeknownst to CT-41, air circulates all throughout the city through iron and stone tubing, and is circulated upward toward the Aquifer to preserve the correct atmospheric composition and to use the large body of water to regulate temperature.</p>

				<p>CT-41 returns to the Gathering Place, and near the top eastern corner of the room notices a large, cracked effigy of a Dragon protruding from the chamber wall. CT-41 shoots the statue with the Impact Cannon, and it crumbles away, revealing a large passageway. CT-41 enters the stone ductwork, and moves through dark and undecorated tunnels before finding itself in a vent through which a powerful current passes. CT-41 works its way downward, finding several other pathways that lead to similar statues, hidden perches through which it cannot pass.</p>

				<p>CT-41 eventually reaches the base of an enormous mechanical room, and begins to move down the ancient iron railings and stairs at the side of the chamber. Dominating the space are two gigantic bellows, attached to a huge iron rod. When CT-41 reaches the room's floor it sees a single, gargantuan, and beautifully carved stone swinging ponderously back and forth across the chamber. This symbol of slow and inexorable time is the beating heart of Thosmodeme's kingdom.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves west across the room, wary of the pendulum swinging in the back ground, and finds an enormous Dragon firmly planted in front of a pathway leading west. Like the Sphinx CT-41 killed in the Antechamber, this Draconid Guardian is armored, and pulses with a strange light from within. CT-41 moves forward, and the Dragon lashes out.</p>

				<p>Although this Dragon is less agile than the Sphynx, it is able to fly, and will take to the air of the chamber to reposition itself against CT-41 and deliver sweeping laser blasts. It occasionally rams against the sides of the chamber, if CT-41 climbs the railings, or slams down against the ground if CT-41 remains there. These attacks rattle the foundations of the Temple. The Dragon periodically returns to the ground to rest, and does not hesitate to come galloping toward CT-41 to attack.</p>

				<p>Once CT-41 destroys the Guardian's armor, it begins to deal greivous injury, and eventually wears the Dragon down. The Dragon returns to the ground and slumps over, leaving its eternal carcass on the floor of the battleground. The Fragment that possessed the dead vessel is trapped in the Necrolith, permanently increasing its available energy.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves into the previously guarded passageway, and down a now dusty corridor closed off at its western end by a lowered stone door. Powder falls from the ceiling as CT-41 moves past, and a sizable stone block falls from the ceiling. CT-41 passes over an iron pressure switch set into the stone of the ground, and the door begins to raise, but as soon as CT-41 moves off the switch the door is released and slams back down. CT-41 moves the fallen stone onto the pressure switch, and passes under the door. Shortly after it does so, the door slams back down.</p>

				<p>CT-41 continues down the corridor until it enters the Tribute Chamber, a completely unlit room filled with hundreds of different Native items and artifacts. The husks of hundreds of small, withered lifeforms roll eerily across the floor. At the back of the chamber, hidden in a dusty pile of junk, CT-41 finds a canister containing Time Crystals.</p>

				<p>CT-41 is initially unaware of what the Time Crystals do, but when it opens its inventory it sees that they are coupled with Kozlov's Toy. CT-41 may learn to use the Time Crystals in the Tribute Chamber, and certainly learns to use them as it leaves the Tribute Chamber. When CT-41 returns to the fallen stone door it finds a pressure switch on the door's western side, but has no stone to place on the switch.</p>

				<p>CT-41 begins to experiment with the Crystals, and learns that it can place itself on the pressure switch, lift the door, and then let it fall. After letting the door fall, it uses the Reverse Beam created by Kozlov's Toy to move the door backward in time and up into the ceiling, passing under it and escaping its momentary prison. If CT-41 ever returns to the hall of the Pendulum after defeating Thosmodeme, it will find the Pendulum stilled.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">The Voice Of Many Waters</div>
				
				<p>The acquisition of the Time Crystals introduces a new and strange assortment of powers and puzzles to CT-41, which feature prominently throughout the second half of its journey. Beginning here, at the halfway point of its exploration of Thosmodeme's Temple, CT-41's mission becomes one of undoing, returning, and forgiving. The Time Crystals make many miraculous acts possible, and demand that CT-41 fundamentally alter its understanding of its universe.</p>

				<p>Manipulations performed by CT-41 as it uses the Time Crystals include:</p>

				<p>Moving a rushing enemy backward.</p>

				<p>Restoring a dead creature to life.</p>

				<p>Riding a fallen object back up to its point of origin.</p>

				<p>Crushing an enemy or an object between a reversing object and a wall.</p>

				<p>Reversing the movement direction of a conveyor or moving platform.</p>

				<p>Manipulating a Glowstone into a prior state.</p>

				<p>Reassembling an broken object.</p>

				<p>Reversing a small object in order to move an object of enormous mass, or generating enormous force.</p>

				<p>Through much of the remainder of its journey through the Temple, CT-41 must use these strategies and others to progress. Many of the Temple's doors open in response to stone or iron pressure switches, which CT-41 must operate correctly.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves back to the top-eastern corner of the Temple, toward the Sentinel that blocks its passage upward.  West of the Sentinel it notices a slow drip and a hollow above a stone on the ceiling, and shoots it with the Impact Cannon. The stone becomes dislodged, and falls. After it settles, CT-41 stands on the stone and shoots it with the Reverse Beam. The stone rises from the ground, returning to its original location and carrying CT-41 into a new passageway, several meters from the Sentinel.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves up through a series of slick stony tunnels, and through a grate near a breeding pool in the Servants' Quarters. In the Quarters CT-41 encounters and fights many of the Servants of Thosmodeme, and must occasionally use its new Reverse Beam to best these Servants in combat. CT-41 passes through feeding and drinking troughs, waste and composting pits overrun by filthy vermin, and chambers designed to imitate natural environments.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves west into a second Residential Sector, one that has been much more well maintained than the lower-eastern Sector. This Sector is built in the same structural style, but Servants have kept it pristine and ready to receive any new Lumene Children whom Thosmodeme judges worthy of living in his holy home. There are two pathways leading down into the Temple, but both are guarded by Sentinels. CT-41 tries to move up and west out of the Residential Sector, but finds yet another Sentinel.</p>

				<p>CT-41 turns around and heads back the way it came, but notices a loose patch of soil in the floor of the tunnel. CT-41 shoots it with the Sonic Auger, and moves down into an earthy cavity. As CT-41 moves west, it discovers that it can see the fleshy mid-section of the Sentinel that blocked it. CT-41 attacks the Sentinel's side, and after a sustained attack, blasts it open. The Sentinel dies quickly afterward, and its two ends open. CT-41 jumps up into the Sentinel's putrefying body, and proceeds west.</p>

				<p>CT-41 is now in the Aquifer, a series of low-hanging, stratified, water-filled caverns, where droplets of moisture fall from stalactites into long pools below. Water from the Aquifer flows throughout the Holy City via its many aqueducts, after flitering through slabs of porous stone. CT-41 is unable to pass through the cleansing stones, and instead continues west through the Aquifer.</p>

				<p>In a chamber at the center of the Aquifer CT-41 encounters a third and final Draconid Guardian, an enormous and glowing Hydra. This fearsome beast moves swiftly through the waters of its home, knocking CT-41 from any perch it finds, and dragging it down into the depths of the pool. If CT-41 defeats the Hydra it will gain another lesser Fragment of Thosmodeme, adding to its now considerable Necrolith energy.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves all the way to the western edge of the Aquifer, and continues into a region called the Labyrinth. This area of many twisted tunnels and intermittent chambers is a mine, from which Laborers once extracted iron ores. Many robust Servant strains are present here, and these impede CT-41 on its journey. CT-41 sees evidences of primitive mining activities, mostly gouge marks, striking tools, ragged artificial tunnels, and piles of extracted materials. CT-41 cannot move all the way down through the Labyrinth, but is able to re-enter the Temple via the Forge at its top-western corner.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">The Well Is Deep</div>

				<!--

				CT-41 moves through the Cells, and finds the winding stair that leads down toward the Well Of Offering
				CT-41 defeats the Temple Guard that protects the Well's chamber
				CT-41 enters the Well
				(Water entering the Well, rather than being drawn out)
				
				-->

				<p>In the Forge, the sacred workplace of the ancient Laborers, CT-41 finds huge furnaces, buckets, pulley operated hammers, quenching vats, and stores of stock iron. Air and water pour through the Forge, which is operated and defended by adept Servants. The iron worked here is similar in property and form to the decorative and structural iron found throughout the Temple. All Servants in the Forge are armored, and many wield brutal iron weapons.</p>

				<p>Pressing east, CT-41 exits the Forge, and moves down into Correction Cells, sensory deprivation chambers where Thosmodeme held the most defiant of Natives. Within the cells are the filth, and sometimes the remains, of many Natives of the High Lineages. With the help of the Oustider, CT-41 peers into the broken Seed of a Native Engineer it finds in one of the Correction Cells.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"Caretaker, this Engineer's Seed is broken, and I cannot empower him to join us. Still, it may be possible to speak with him, if only a little, and learn what we can from him."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 moves to the Engineer's Seed, and attempts to communicate.</p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Hello, Engineer."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Engineer: <em>"I hear you, Lord! Forgive me!"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What cause do you have to ask me for forgiveness?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Engineer: <em>"I once harbored evil thoughts in my troubled mind, and rejected your Presence. But I am changed, by your patient and loving intervention. I embrace you as my Lord, freely and fully. Please, release me from this darkness!"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I am not your Lord, I am a Caretaker automaton."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Engineer: <em>"Yes, truly you are our Caretaker. I know this now. If it is your will, I would leave this cell, to be your Child, and to act in your stead in the world."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"You cannot leave this cell, Engineer. Your body is dead, and your Seed is broken."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Engineer: <em>"I was dead without you, Lord, and my Seed was poisoned by my many vain and willful thoughts. But no longer!"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I told you I am not your Lord. Why do you address me by that title?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Engineer: <em>"Because you ARE my Lord, and though I did not know it, you are the great benefactor of my people! I live to praise you, and to receive your instruction. I have become meek as a Laborer, gentle as a Nurturer. When my end comes, I hope to be joined with you, as one of the Willing."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"You confuse me for the Tyrant. I am not he."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Engineer: <em>"The faithless would seize upon the words of this test, Lord, to blaspheme against you. Not I! My love is pure, and my faith unwavering. The truth of your nature shines brightly, even through the words that would tempt the weak."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I am not your Lord!"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Engineer: <em>"And yet I will worship you! I no longer yearn for the Hearth, for it is far from your Holy City. The cares of the world are forever extinguished in me, and the wound of the Shame is healed. I am Purified."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"You consider yourself to be my Child, and me to be your Lord?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Engineer: <em>"Yes, with all my being."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"And there is nothing I can say to convince you otherwise?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Engineer: <em>"Nothing, Lord."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"..."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog"><em>"Your Lord asks, 'What will you of me, my Child?'"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Engineer: <em>"I knew it was you, Lord, I never doubted! I would be honored to do your will!"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Then softly enter into a sweet and endless rest, Child, in which you know only joy."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Engineer: <em>"Thank you, Father!"</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 moves away from the body of the Engineer, and continues exploring the western half of the Temple. It eventually finds a winding stair, leading downward toward the lower-western quadrant of the Temple. Light filters up from beneath as CT-41 descends. When it reaches the base of the stair, CT-41 finds itself in a delicately adorned room, whose walls are inlaid with brilliant iridescent Glowstone. CT-41 moves west, until it enters a beautiful domed room. At the center of this room is an opening, the Well Of Offering. A stone bridge extends halfway across the Well, before coming to an abrupt end. CT-41 rolls out past the end of the incomplete bridge, and falls.</p>
