				<p>After it has defeated Fesh'togar and captured him in the Necrolith, CT-41 leaves the Sanctum of the Spirit of Air. It moves into a lower portion of the Healers' Locus, where fluid filled tanks once held Natives and other creatures while they recovered from injury or surgery. Lights are sparsely installed in this wing of the Locus, and flicker periodically. Many of the tanks are broken, or occupied by skeletal or putrefied remains. In the easternmost life support chamber CT-41 finds a tank that has been well maintained, and is illuminated by bright, steady light.</p>

				<p>In this last life support unit Fesh'togar has kept a single captured Native alive. Much of the Native's exoskeleton and flesh has fallen from it or been stripped away, and its neural tendrils are exposed, branching out from its Seed, which emits a soft cyan light. Before CT-41 has a chance to act, the Companion enters its mind.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"Caretaker, this Kinsman is a Healer, and he is still alive. For some reason, I cannot enter his mind... His optical organs appear healthy, however. We should be able to communicate in the traditional speech of my people."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"This Healer has suffered much, Caretaker. We should grant him whatever he asks of us..."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 speaks. The Necrolith produces extremely fast pulses of light, which vary in breadth, intensity, and duration.</p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Hello, Healer."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"What feeble trickery this is! Your earlier deceptions at least had the virtue of subtilty. You must be growing desparate indeed... Is Father getting hungry?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I do not understand. I am not attempting to deceive you, Healer."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"You have called me 'Healer' twice now. Is the word supposed to be ingratiating? After all this time, do you expect me to yield because you decide to be POLITE?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I am confused. Who do you suppose that I am?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"I would call you 'Tormentor', but that just isn't true, is it? Seeing you fail, over and over again, has actually given me great satisfaction."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I am not a tormentor. I am CT-41, a Caretaker automaton. For a long time I have traveled through the dwellings of your people. I defeated a being of great power to gain access to this room."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"Maybe you are, and maybe you did... And maybe I am a Warrior."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"No, you are not. My translator has told me that you are a Healer."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"Of course I'm not a Warrior, you idiot! They've been extinct since the... You aren't very good at this game, are you? And seeing as you aren't very good at it, stop calling me 'Healer'. I was much more comfortable with 'Heretic'. Let's get back to what we do best. You torture, and I laugh."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I have no intention of torturing you. I wish to help you, if I can."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"Well isn't this a relief! No more torture, only games! Let's play, 'Caretaker'. What can you tell me about your early childhood?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I came to this world with as part of a *human* colonization and exploration mission. My *mother*, *Jessica Arai*, assembled me..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"Give me a moment to catch up, that was a lot of information..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>(Caretaker, when you use words like 'human', 'mother', and 'Jessica Arai', I have to encode and transmit enormous amounts of data. I just defined concepts such as humanity, sexual dimorphism, and phonetic language for this Healer. Please pace yourself.)</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"Ok, I'm ready again. What were you saying about coming from across the emptiness, to be birthed by a half of a parent, whose name is a noise? ...Don't answer, the question was obviously rhetorical; I don't care about your pathetic fictions. You must know by now that I cannot be broken, and I will never give up the Secret Thought. Kill me, and please, find a more productive way to spend your time. I hate to think of how you must feel after inventing such a preposterous story."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I did not come here to kill you. What is the Secret Thought?"</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"This act, this feigned ignorance, is unbecoming. I will speak to you no more. Kill me!"</em></p>

				<p>Left with no other options, CT-41 chooses to kill the Healer by destroying its tank. CT-41 blasts the tank with the Impact Cannon, and the glass shatters. Liquid flows quickly over the jagged edges of the broken tank, and the Healer falls to its floor. Its light goes out as its tendrils curl and shrivel. The Companion speaks to CT-41 again.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"Perhaps now we may talk to this Healer, but as he truly is."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 moves through the shattered glass and water to the pitiable corpse of the Healer, and speaks to its Seed.</p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Hello, Healer."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"I am in darkness. I died... The Tormentor would never have allowed me to die... Who are you?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I am CT-41, a Caretaker automaton."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"And how are you speaking to me?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"You saw my companion earlier, a floating yellow orb. He is one of your people, whose mind lives inside an empowered Seed. He translates for me, and allows me to communicate directly with your Seed."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"I know that Seeds can be induced to process information, even after death. The Executors house a Seed, and many Seeds form the Nucleus. But I never thought a Seed could continue to experience its thought. The presumption was that the crystallized Seed behaved as an organic computer..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"...and this might be part of the deception. I could reassemble the Secret Thought, you know, and cast you out... But it seems you are not my enemy. If you were the Tormentor, or the Tyrant himself, you would have already seized hold..."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I am not your enemy. What is the Secret Thought?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"The Secret Thought is my creation, a protection against intrusions into the mind. Do you know of the Tyrant, Caretaker?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Yes."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"Then you know of his power to control subtle, organic minds. He has a much more difficult time influencing highly deterministic brains, such as I imagine yours to be. If it isn't too much of a bother, I'd like to tell you how I came to develop my Secret Thought. It's just been so long since I spoke to someone who wasn't also trying to inflict terrible pain on me..."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I would be glad to hear your tale."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"Where to start? ...Ah. For the many Turns of our Subjugation the Tyrant monitored our thoughts, and subjected us to his 'Purification' when they diverged from his. If we attempted to wrest our thoughts back from the Tyrant, we were punished. Those who proved too difficult to tame were cast into the Pit. With time, the Remnant became docile, and the victorious Tyrant rested. There was peace, of a sort, and maybe even prosperity."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"But a time came when our Laborers began to change. They had been under the Tyrant's influence for so long, and so completely, that they could no longer exist as themselves. Their minds atrophied, or took shelter in deep chambers, far from the light. When the Tyrant withdrew his Presence from them, only the inert shells of Laborers remained. The Laborers' children inherited these broken minds, and shared in the doom of their parents."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"This condition was called 'hollowing'. To my knowledge, no Kinsman ever became hollowed. Our minds were not simple like the Laborers', and existed in places that theirs did not. We clung to our memories, and did not lose ourselves. Yet I suppose we too might have become hollowed, given enough time."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Have any of my words confused you, Caretaker?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"None."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"Wonderful! You do seem to have a bright little mind. I have never heard of an artificial lifeform so capable as you... Regardless, the hollowed Laborers became a burden to the Tyrant. He had to maintain them at every instant, and his Presence was spread thin. Like all tyrants, he desired an impossibility: To compel free and intelligent beings. As such, the Laborers no longer interested him. He had a choice to make, and chose poorly."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"The Tyrant abandoned the hollowed Laborers, removing his Presence from their minds. They ceased to move. To Healers, Laborers are like our own children. Over many Turns under our tutelage, we suppressed their base tendencies, taught them a simple language, and brought them up into the world of society as our own. We advocated for them before the Council every quarter Turn. The uplifting of the Laborers was our greatest work. And we watched as their bodies withered away, and they starved in their own filth."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"As our adopted children died, we Healers cried out as one against the Tyrant, and vexed him greatly. He was taken by surprise, and shaken. He could not control us all. And in this moment of chaos, I had time to think, alone, and as myself."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I was once a Healer of minds, Caretaker. It is a credit to my ancestors that I guessed the secret of the False God's control. In order to introduce thought into a lesser mind, a dominant mind must simulate it perfectly. Without an empathetic connection, attempts at compulsion produce nothing more than mental static, delusion, and great pain. This process of mental alignment I dubbed 'synchronization'".</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"If the greater mind must synchronize with the lesser in order to control it, it stood to reason that, by thinking a thought that the Tyrant could not emulate, we might escape his control entirely. With my limited and uncertain freedom, I nevertheless conceived of such a thought, one so alien to the Tyrant's nature, that he could not possibly possess it, and yet remain himself."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"In an instant the Presence no longer strove against me. I shared my thought with the Healers around me, and it spread to the other lineages. We were free."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What happened after you won your freedom?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"Perhaps someone else can tell you that tale. I am happy for the first time in many Lives, and I do not want to think of things that cause me pain."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Also, I would like to beg your pardon for how rudely I spoke to you earlier. I was convinced that you were some new guise assumed by a devil, and I treated you disdainfully."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"There is nothing to forgive. I am curious, though: What precisely was the thought that freed you from the Tyrant?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"That, I cannot tell you. It is a secret thought, after all!"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What name should I call you?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Healer: <em>"My fellows called me 'Deliverer', before the end."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Why did the Tormentor hold you captive here?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Deliverer: <em>"He prolonged my life in this tank, subjecting me to pain and lies as my body slowly fell apart. I lived for many Turns, far longer than is natural for my people. The Tormentor waited eagerly for me to abandon the Secret Thought, and again serve the Tyrant."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Yet the Tormentor could never threaten me with death. I would have welcomed it, of course. And the Tormentor's true goal, once I had released the Thought, was to force me to breed new children for the Tyrant. That I would never do."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What do you intend to do now?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Deliverer: <em>"I don't intend to do anything. Once you leave, I suppose I will again recede into the pleasing dark and stillness of death."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"You have suffered much, Healer, and you deserve rest, but I would ask something more of you. I oppose the Tyrant, and all False Gods. My translator can empower you, both to see through my eyes, and to move through the air. Will you join me in my journeys, and render me what aid you can?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Deliverer: <em>"That is my wish, Caretaker. No rest will be sweet while strangers pollute Creation."</em></p>

				<p>The Deliverer's Seed rises from the ruin of its life support tank, and joins the Necrolith and whatever other Seeds CT-41 has accumulated. CT-41 leaves the chamber of the Deliverer's rebirth. The Healer's Seed can cooperate with the Necrolith, granting CT-41's Nanite Colony to heal it much more rapidly than before. Soon after CT-41 leaves, the Deliverer speaks to it again.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Deliverer: <em>"One more thing, Caretaker: I told you I was once a Healer of minds. Before the Tyrant, and the subjugation, I developed and used Regression Treatments to help my patients whose chains of memory had been damaged.

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"One of my patients, a disgraced Explorer, was brought to me by Rulers who had questioned him. This Explorer had damaged his own chain very badly, presumably to protect someone, another Explorer. For my treatment to work, I needed access to certain memories that would have allowed me to repair the chain..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"And as I've been speaking to you, I've come to believe I know whose memories might have helped my patient. I am speaking, of course, of your translator."</em></p>
