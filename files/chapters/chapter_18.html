				<p>After defeating Uruthmu, CT-41 return to the Geothermal Power Station, and enters the door at the base of the station. The door opens into an elevator, that moves through the Magma Chamber down toward the Mineral Separation Plant. CT-41 stops the elevator at Magma Observatory and moves east into the transparent scientific habitat. CT-41 finds a large magma lock with clamps and a docking portal inside. CT-41 attempts to open the door to the Magma Chamber, and the chamber rapidly fills with magma before the doors opens. CT-41 uses the Turbine to move through the Magma Chamber briefly, but must quickly return to the Magma Observatory as its shields and integrity drop. Magma is much more viscuous than water, and CT-41 is unable to achieve high speeds in the Chamber.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves down toward the the Mineral Separation Plant to continue its explorations there. The Plant contains pools of magma from which minerals were extracted and refined. Some of the pools have cooled, and flaky cooled lava is present throughout. Much of the dried magma is cracked, and CT-41 can blast it apart with its Impact Cannon. CT-41 sees magma passing through tubing all throughout the Separation Plant, and takes note of several large diameter pipes leading east.</p>

				<p>CT-41 must be careful to avoid the large bubbling vats of lava and separated minerals in the Plant. Certain rooms here are hot enough that simply entering the room will drain CT-41's shield or reduce its integrity. At the far western end of the Plant CT-41 finds giant casting machines that produce metal ingots and bars, which are warehoused there before being moved to the Factory. CT-41 finds a changing room with several protective suits, and a Thermal Barrier, which it equips. With the Barrier CT-41 takes significantly less damage in magma and in heated rooms.</p>

				<p>Near the base of the Mineral Separation Plant CT-41 runs into several of the Engineers' Locus Doors, and is unable to continue its explorations there. It returns to the Magma Observatory, and again enters the Magma Chamber. Protected by the Thermal Barrier, CT-41 is able to swim much further into the magma, and discovers another magma lock at the base of the Chamber east of the Mineral Separation Plant, next to two large tubes. This lock leads to a disposal facility filled with pumping equipment that connects to the lower portion of the Plant.</p>

				<p>In the lower portion of the Mineral Separation Plant CT-41 encounters several new creatures of the fiery biome of the Deep. These organisms are typically heavily armored and robustly built. CT-41 navitages through the infiltrated Mineral Separation Plant, moving west toward the Factory.</p>

				<p>When CT-41 finishes moving through the base of Mineral Separation Plant, it enters a corridor leading to the Factory. At the center of this corridor is a guard chamber, similar to the one in front of the Ancestral Halls. Within is the Iron Executor. Unlike the Bronze Executor, the Iron Executor is neither corroded nor decrepit, and its armor gleams. The Executor quickly emerges from its crouched position as soon as CT-41 enters its visual field, and moves aggresively toward CT-41.</p>

				<p>CT-41 fights the Iron Executor, whose mobility and available weaponry greatly exceed those of its predecessor. The Executor can jump, has a powerful flamethrower that leaves flames burning for several seconds, and uses a heavy concussive weapon to dislodge CT-41 from cover. It has a functional shield unlike the Bronze Executor, and its armor is durable. CT-41 must deal high damage in bursts to be able to break the Executor's shields and damage it. When CT-41 finally breaks the Executor's armor and shielding, the Executor begins to flash as its self-destruct timer begins. It explodes, dealing high non-lethal damage and knockback to CT-41, and blasting the doors off of its chamber. CT-41 notices a strange purple liquid staining the Exectuor's remains.</p>

				<p>CT-41 continues west and enters the Factory. There are no Lumene lifeforms here, due to the presence of the Iron Executor. CT-41 sees a gauntlet of hammers, stamps, presses, lasers, chemical vats and rollers. Without all three Materials necessary to produce a Speed, Slow and Stop beam with Kozlov's Toy, CT-41 is unable to pass through the assembly lines of the Factory, but does discover a natural drainage path downward.</p>

				<p>CT-41 falls into the western control and emission room of the Accelerator. The Accelerator itself is a standard linear accelerator, with the difference that it has four gateways that periodically activate. Leveraging the Gateway technology, Native engineers were able to accelerate two relatively large pellets of material over and over, an arbitrarily high number of times. The tubes and collision chamber of the Accelerator are kept in a vacuum, and CT-41 enters the tubing and chamber through an airlock.</p>

				<p>In order to pass through the Accelerator, CT-41 must operate three of the Accelerator's controls using the Native Prosthetic. These controls release pellets, activate electrical fields, and open the accelerator's gateways. In order to clear the Accelerator chamber and reach the other side, CT-41 must enable the electrical field and the gateways, but disable the particle emitters. If the accelerators and gateways are not activated, CT-41 will not be able to clear the collision chamber. If all three controls are active, CT-41 will be instantly killed by the accelerated pellet from the eastern end of the accelerator.</p>

				<p>When CT-41 sets the proper controls, it can use the Accelerator to gain enough speed to leap accross the collision chamber once the gateways deactivate. While the Accelerator is activated, lights throughout the Underground become dimmed due to the enormous power requirements of the device. CT-41 moves through the eastern tube, and in the eastern control area finds a broken Particle Emitter that it can nonetheless adapt and use as a weapon.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves out of the climate controlled Particle Accelerator through several airlocks, and enters the Fire Caves. No liquid water is present in these scorching chambers, but bubble magma pools dot the area. In certain areas the magma has cooled into bulbous mounds and spouts, or into scab-like layers atop pools that disintegrate as soon as CT-41 touches them.</p>

				<p>The creatures of the Fire Caverns are all Servants of the Fragment Azeselon, and coordinate to attack CT-41. The Servants are hardy and well armored, and many creatures live in the magma itself. CT-41 encounters Hellhounds in the Fire Caves, slower but more heavily armored Hunters, which like Hunters resemble Native Pets. The Hellhounds are territorial and aggressive, and group up to pursue CT-41.</p>

				<p>CT-41 navigates past spouts of magma and steam, deep magma pools, collapsing caverns and dangerous foes, until it arrives at Azeselon's Sanctum. Here CT-41 encounters the most powerful member of the Draconid family, the Dragons. These powerful creatures are larger and more heavily armored than either Wyverns or Krakens. Though they are less agile than their brethren, Dragons are nevertheless highly mobile, and pose a significant threat to CT-41.</p>

				<p>CT-41 at last falls directly downward into a huge chamber without any apparent exits. There is a huge and bubbling lake of magma that spans the entire room. Within the chamber are several footholds for CT-41, but they are few and far between.</p>

				<p>Soon after CT-41 falls into the room, the form of Azeselon appears. Like other Fragments and singularities, Azeselon's nature and appearance are completely distinct from the products of evolution or mechanical design. He is an ever changing, living totem or emblem, impossible to confuse with the products of Creation. Azeselon commands founts of magma toward CT-41, knocking him from his perches. When Azeselon takes damage from CT-41, its physical form disappears. The magma of his abode will become white hot, boiling and splattering damaging particles upward. When in this state immersion in the magma deals incredibly high damage, forcing CT-41 to seek refuge. Each time the water boils it rises higher, reducing the number of platforms above the surface of the magma. By the time Azeselon decoheres, there is only one platform left for CT-41 to stand on.</p>

				<p>When CT-41 overwhelms Azeselon, its decoherent Self is drawn toward and trapped in the Necrolith, and available Necrolith energy increases. The level of the magma in the room drops, and CT-41 is able to move down and out of the chamber. As it moves back west toward the Accelerator, CT-41 enters a hidden chamber, built by Native Engineers, where a vial of Hyperons is kept safe. With the Hyperons in its inventory, CT-41 can now produce a Speed Beam with Kozlov's Toy, which accelerates a target object to twice its normal speed.</p>
