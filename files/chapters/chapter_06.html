				<p>Now that it has the Recruit's Rank Card, CT-41 is able to enter and pass through the Guardhouse at the western end of the mining complex. Inside this Guardhouse CT-41 finds more Marine remains, left as they fell. Disturbed, CT-41 passes through and leaves the colonized portion of the Fortuna Crater, venturing out onto ground that is neither paved nor leveled. Many slow moving nocturnal Lumene lifeforms are present here, far from the bright lights of the Colony.</p>

				<p>CT-41 finally reaches the western edge of the Crater. There it finds a fissure in the ground, between rocks at the base of the cliff. CT-41 enters the fissure, and begins to explore the dimly lit Caverns beneath it. Drops of water trickle from the ceiling, and strange, glowing creatures move slowly along the walls towards CT-41. CT-41's visibility is limited, but the biolumiscent creatures and its running lights allow it to navigate. CT-41 moves through several caverns, and discovers dark passages infested with creatures it can barely see.</p>

				<p>Due to difficulties moving through the pitch dark caverns, CT-41 pursues other avenues of exploration, and in a chamber down and to the east it finds a tripod with a camera mounted on it. In the next chamber over, a dead end, CT-41 finds a Flashlight, a PDR, and a human skull. CT-41 reads Ormeil's PDR, and grabs and equips the Flashlight. With the flashlight CT-41 is able to clearly see in a wide cone wherever it is pointed.</p>

				<p>CT-41 begins to optimize its Thermal Laser in these caverns, and discovers that the Sonic Auger can be used as a weapon. While it does not do nearly as much damage as the Thermal Laser, the Sonic Auger does have a slight knockback effect.</p>

				<!--
				the wild beast shall tear them
				I will also send wild beasts among you
				the wild beasts of the earth
				the wild beast may break them
				wild beasts of the desert shall lie there
				wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air
				-->

				<p>With the Sonic Auger, CT-41 continues to dig through the areas of the Caverns where loose soils have accumulated. Eventually CT-41 enters a drier and more barren region of the Caverns, where it finds the dead husks of several large Lumene creatures. The tunnels that connect the chambers here appear to have been created by a primitive agent, rather than by geological processes, and large gouge marks are visible on the walls. In this complex CT-41 finds caverns where water has accumulated in artificial pools, and battles several juvenile Beasts. At the base of this network of tunnels CT-41 falls into the den of a fully grown Beast, which attacks it ferociously. CT-41 cannot escape the Beast's chamber, and is forced to fight. After a difficult battle, CT-41 mortally injures the Beast, which attempts to flee, smashing through an artificial wall of tightly packed stone that leads to its trophy pit. The Beast falls dead in the passageway leading to the pit, after curling into a defensive posture.

				<p>After defeating the Beast, CT-41 passes over its body and enters its trophy pit. Here the Beast had stored pieces of hundreds of creatures. Among the remains is the suited skeleton of Nicholas Ormeil, and his Ensign's Rank Card. CT-41 uses the Sonic Auger to dislodge a boulder from the roof of the trophy pit. It pushes this boulder east, and then jumps onto the boulder. From the boulder it is able to jump up onto a ledge that leads it out of the Beast's Den.</p>

				<small>"And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth."</small>
