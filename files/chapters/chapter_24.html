				<p>After the Outsider leaves the Farsight Colony, CICI informs CT-41 that interstellar communication has been cut off.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">CICI: <em>"Hello, Caretaker. I have bad news. With the damage done to the Communications Bunker, we can no longer send interstellar transmissions, and I will no longer be able to send transmissions to Earth."</em></p>

				<p>For many years after the Outsider breaks into the Colony, CT-41 has the option to freely explore the surface and depths of Lumen 2, discovering hidden items, materials and lore. After #NUMBER years pass in exploration or time compression, CT-41 receives a broad spectrum transmission.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Manigault: <em>"Farsight colonists, this is Director Jusuf Manigault of the IDFS Paralus. By the authority of the IDF, I hereby take command of all colonial and military facilities, equipment and personnel in the Lumen system."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"The Paralus is currently stationed in orbit above Lumen 2. Our scans of the Farsight Colony indicate that its communications equipment is damaged, and likely inoperable. If you have another means of communication, we will be monitoring all frequencies for your response. If we do not receive a response in one hour's time, be advised that we will begin our descent to the Fortuna crater to establish contact with you."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 is unable to make contact with the orbital Paralus, and must wait for the vessel to descend. After an hour passes, CT-41 receives another transmission.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Manigault: <em>"Farsight colony, this is Director Manigault. We are beginning our descent to the Fortuna crater. By my order, all colonial personnel are to report immediately to the Fortuna Crater. From there you will be directed by IDF personnel to the bridge of the Paralus to be debriefed."</em></p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Arise, Go Up To Meet The Messengers</div>

				<p>Once the Paralus reaches its destination in the Fortuna Crater, Manigault sends out a personal invitation to CT-41.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Manigault: <em>"CT-41, this is Director Manigault. It's great to see that you are still operational! Please report to me on the Paralus, there is much for us to discuss."</em></p>
				
				<p>If CT-41 obeys the order, it will be greeted on the surface by two of the Paralus' crewmen near near its personnel lift. One of the crewmen is a hulking form of a man, covered in exoskeletal enhancements and what appear to be wespons. The other crewman is much smaller and more delicately featured, dressed in flowing robes, with only a small cranial attachment. CT-41 attempts to communicate with the larger and more intimidating of the two men.</p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Hello, I am CT-41. Who are you?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Crewman: <em>"I am the Agent of the Executive Triad."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is your name?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Agent: <em>"Agent."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Why has the Paralus come to Lumen 2?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Agent: <em>"You will direct further inquiries to Coordinator Alo'nutra."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41 then approaches Alo'nutra, the smaller and more elegant of the Paralus' representatives.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Alo'nutra: <em>"Hello CT-41, it's an honor to meet you. I am Alo'nutra, and I serve as the Paralus' chief Coordinator. Director Manigault is eager to speak with you, and to learn everything that has happened since the Native sent his message... Ah. He tells me he has a gift for you. 'In keeping with tradition', he says."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Why do you say it is an honor to meet me?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Alo'nutra: <em>"I suppose you are unaware of your own celebrity. You are, quite possibly, the single most important artificial being humanity has ever created. Your journeys on Lumen 2 are the subject of endless study and debate. Many scholars believe that without the analyses of Lumene technology you and CICI have sent back to Earth, the War against the Destroyers would have been lost long ago. The Oracle agrees."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is the Oracle?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Alo'nutra: <em>"There must be so much you don't know! You can ask the members of our Cooperative whatever questions occur to you."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Why has the Paralus come to Lumen 2?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Alo'nutra: <em>"That is an excellent question, and I will let Director Manigault answer it for you. Please feel free to board the Paralus at your convenience. The Personnel Lift will carry you up into the Storage Bay. From there navigation to the Bridge should be trival."</em></p>
				
				<p>CT-41 moves onto the personnel lift, and is carried up into the front of the Paralus's Storage Bay. Once aboard it sees rows and rows of imposing military robots lining the walls. These robots are inactive, but cast a shadow of menace over the spacious compartment. Doors leading toward the aft of the Paralus do not open to CT-41, and indicators on the walls and above doors direct it toward the Bridge.</p>

				<p>If CT-41 moves to the Bridge of the Paralus without receiving an Override Order from Director Manigault, it will have the oportunity to speak with several crew members of the Paralus along the way. All human officers aboard the Paralus are noticeably taller and more gracile than the humans who arrived on the Argo, and are even taller than the humans bred in the Sanctuary, and the relatively low gravity of Lumen 2. They are without exception phenotypically male. All have cranial attachments, and many have other technological customizations and enhancements.</p>

				<p>As CT-41 moves along it sees several humans in the background plugged into I/O stations, or attached via their umbilical valves to Serum dispensers.<p>

			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">He That Formed Thee From The Womb</div>

				<p>CT-41 moves into a Birthing Center on its way to the Bridge. Artificial Wombs line the walls, containing fetuses ranging from the size of a bean to the size of a 5 year old. The more fully developed children have cranial attachments, though none have any hair, nipples, or genitals. At a work station in the Birthing Center CT-41 finds a crewman, and speaks to him.<p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Hello, I am CT-41. Who are you?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Crewman: <em>"Salutations, CT-41, it is a most Resplendent Honor to meet your Excellency. Please Gratuitously Follow the Indicative Indicators to the bridge. I am Highly Assured that Director Manigault is eager to engage in Social Intercourse. Pardon me, I am Extremely Excessively Loquacious. Please do not hesitate to Meticulously Interrogate me."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is your name?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Crewman: <em>"Please Generously Endow me with your Ample Pardon! Phonetically, I am called 'Momo', though my Digital Nomenclature is Quite Distinct."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"How did you come to have the name Momo?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Crewman: <em>"'Momo' was my first Discernible Vocalization after I emerged from my Artificial Womb."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is an Artificial Womb?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Crewman: <em>"The Artificial Womb fosters the growth of Fetal Masses. Enhanced Humans are unburdened by Reproductive Aparatus and Enticements of your Bygone Age, and instead we leave the Arduous Enterprise of Reproduction to more Reliable Technologies. Sexual Dimorphism and its Accompanying Inconveniences are now Awkward Memories of a Race in its Infancy. Ha! It is a Witticism!"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What are the devices in the Storage Bay?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Crewman: <em>"The Martial Fabrications are deployed to manage Existential Threats. Their Precise Instruments allow for nearly Instantaneous Disassembly of most Material Entities."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Thank you for the information."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Crewman: <em>"It is with Gratitude Bestowed, Precocious Machinery."</em></p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">I Am Slow Of Speech, And Of A Slow Tongue</div>

				<p>CT-41 continues toward the Bridge, and finds a crewman alone in the corridor, apparently performing some kind of repair or diagnostic work. The crewman is standing next to a toolbox, in front of a wall segment whose cover panel has been removed.<p>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Hello."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Crewman: <em>"..."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Hello?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Crewman: <em>"...Sorry. Long time... communication with verbals. Embarrassment..."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is your name?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Operative: <em>"Designation... not phonetic. Maybe am Operative?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Your speech patterns are irregular. Why is this?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Operative: <em>"Easy talk... Network. Verbals... Difficult. Slow. Primitive."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What are you doing here?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Operative: <em>"No verbals... Ugly. Goodbye sorry ok."</em></p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">The Things That Come Into Your Mind</div>
				
				<p>In front of a locked door with a cryo-hazard symbol CT-41 speaks to another crewman.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Crewman: <em>"Hey buddy, what's up? So cool to finally meet you! What can I do for ya?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is your name?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Crewman: <em>"Well, you can call me Sparkling Cider. I like how it sounds. I got tons of other names, though."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Your speech appears to be anachronistic."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Sparkling Cider: <em>"Well, yeah, I just downloaded a period spoken language pack, informal. Translates what I want to say into something you're more familiar with, ya know? Is it working?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Yes. Why did you download a language pack?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Sparkling Cider: <em>"I'm not a complete nerd, no offense, so I don't do verbals very often. Kinda pompous and weird, right? I don't know... Anyway, I figured if I ran into you I might need to communicate with my mouth like a savage, again, no offense. So I found a good pack and loaded it into my augment."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is an 'augment'? And how do you communicate, if not verbally?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Sparkling Cider: <em>"Sorry dude, I forgot how old you are. My neural augment does a lot of the mental heavy lifting for me. Neurons, electrodes, alpha waves and all that jazz. I can ask it for info, have it run calculations, translate, you name it.</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"It also monitors my brain state, helps prevent tampering when I connect to the Network. You know about the Network? No? Well, it's how I communicate with almost everyone and everything. Blows talking out of the water."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"With your neural augment, do you consider yourself to be a cybernetic organism?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Sparkling Cider: <em>"What? No way! I'm still human, I just keep my tech gadgets in my head instead of in my hand or pocket. Cuts down on lag."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Where does the door behind you lead?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Sparkling Cider: <em>"On the other side of that door is an elevated walkway, and at the end of that walkway is a Stabilization Chamber. We keep the Oracle on ice in there, so all its quantum bits and pieces don't fall apart."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is the Oracle?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Sparkling Cider: <em>"Superintelligence. Think about it like this: If you don't know what to do, or you don't know what the correct answer is, odds are the Oracle does. It's hooked up to the Network, just like us, so if you come to it with a problem, it'll spit out a solution. A whole bunch, if you need 'em. Instances of the Oracle have been the only thing keeping the Destroyers..."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Please continue."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Sparkling Cider: <em>"Nah, I'm good. I'm probably not the one you want to talk to about the War. Anyway, nice talkin' to ya! The Director's waitin'!"</em></p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">A City And A Tower</div>

				<p>CT-41 moves away from Sparkling Cider, and continues following the indicators toward the Bridge. As it moves, doors lock and elevators become inoperable behind it.</p>

				<p>Once it reaches the Bridge of the Paralus, CT-41 has the opportunity to talk talk to two members of the Bridge crew, while several other crewmen can be seen wired into human I/O stalls in the background. The first officer that CT-41 talks to is a seated figure with many wires feeding into his elaborate neural augments.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Officer: <em>"Hello CT-41, I am glad to speak with you, and hope that you will speak with me. I am Observer Ulaan Bataar. Before I became myself, I was crafted to yearn for sight, and to see much. I see you here now, and I am content."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"You say you were crafted. How?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Ulaan Bataar: <em>"We are all crafted, CT-41, much like you, to serve a special purpose. We each know who we are, and what we will be. I do not wish to be Director Manigault, and he does not wish to be me. The gifts we give to our children are the skills and disposition required to happily fulfill the roles they are destined to perform. Many instances of the Oracle have guided the creation and optimization of our genetic birthrights. Thus we live in harmony, having rid ourselves of discordant evolutionary baggage."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Are all children in your society designed to serve a purpose?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Ulaan Bataar: <em>"Yes. We cannot let a child's fate be determined by a roll of the genetic dice, as primitive man once did. That would be a crime, given our power to intervene."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is your role aboard the Paralus?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Ulaan Bataar: <em>"I look at the world around me. I see all that I can, I notice patterns and anomalies, I consult the Oracle, and inform the Director of all that he must know. I observe, the Director chooses, and the Agent acts. As three, and as one, we preside over this vessel, and guide the fates of all aboard it."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"How did you come to be named Ulaan Bataar?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Ulaan Bataar: <em>"Of old Ulaan Bataar was a wandering city, a place of meditation and growth. Ulaan Bataar is where I want to live, and so I do."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What can you tell me of the war against the Destroyers?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Ulaan Bataar: <em>"I see much, but I do not share all that I see. I hope to continue our conversation later, but now the Director wishes to speak with you."</em></p>

			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">A Leader And Commander To The People</div>
				
				<p>If CT-41 does not make its way to the Bridge and speak with Director Manigault within ten minutes of the Paralus' descent, Manigualt issues an <a href="../Encyclopedia/Override Order.html">Override Order</a>, forcing it to make contact.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Manigault: <em>"CT-41, I hesitate to do this, but it seems I have no choice... Begin override order: Report to me on the bridge of the Paralus immediately. End override order."</em></p>

				<p>If it receives this Override Order, CT-41's display will fade to red, and when the display returns CT-41 will find itself aboard the Paralus, being greeted by Director Manigault on the <a href="../Encyclopedia/Bridge.html">Bridge</a>.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Manigault: <em>"I'm sorry I had to issue that override order, CT-41. I have great respect for you, and for all early automata. However, it seems I was unable to impress upon you the urgency of my summons by any other means."</em></p>

				CT-41 must retrieve Outsider, can't just wait for Voronash and Outsider to leave and then go to Nucleus

				-->

				<p>Regardless of how it arrives before the Director, CT-41 finds Manigault seated on an elevated swiveling chair near the western edge of the Bridge. He is currently facing backward, away from the viewport to the west. The chair has the aspect of a throne, and looks down over the Bridge and its crew.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Manigault: <em>"A final welcome to the Paralus, CT-41. I am Jusuf Manigault. The IDF has empowered me to oversee all ongoing operations on Lumen 2. It is my pleasure to inform you that your solitary mission of exploration is at last complete. It is with the utmost gratitude, and in recognition of your many contributions to humanity, that I promote you to the rank of Captain."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I know you've been collecting Rank Cards, so I wanted you to have this. It's a Captain's Card, perfectly preserved, from the ancient Solar Navy. I found it in storage at the Marineris Colonial Museum, and the curator was happy to donate it to you. He, and all of humanity with him, owe you a debt that cannot be repaid with such a simple gift, but I wanted you to have it nonetheless."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Humanity does not owe me anything."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Manigault: <em>"You don't think so? I think humility is clouding your vision, CT-41. As you've explored Lumen 2, the Farsight central computer has sent hundreds of bulk data transmissions to Earth, including your sensory logs and analysis of you acquisitions. There are some historians who argue that, since the dawn of the industrial age, no other single entity has contributed as much to humanity's technological progress."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I appreciate their esteem, but I must warn you that you are in danger here."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Manigault: <em>"Am I? How so?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"There are powerful and dangerous enemies still on this planet."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Manigault: <em>"On that matter we are in perfect agreement, but we are in luck: The most powerful and dangerous beings on this planet all answer to me."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"My mission here is simple, CT-41. I will make contact with the Lumene Native who calls himself 'Outsider'. He has promised humanity and the IDF his assistance in our war against the Destroyers. I will deal with whatever enemies present themselves."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Director, the Outsider is one of those enemies."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Manigault: <em>"Perhaps. However, there are facts to consider. This Outsider is the last known son of a world that was ravaged by Destroyers. He has every reason to hate them, just as we do. He has sent us invaluable technologies, and promises more. In fact, this ship only exists because of the equations and blueprints the Outsider sent us."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What technologies did he send you?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Manigault: <em>"At the center of the Paralus is a Mass Accumulator that enables our Tunnel Drive. The device is a product of genius: It allows us to form a spacetime tunnel between two disparate gravity wells. Hopping from one gravity well to another is a wonderful trick, that vastly reduces the energy requirements for a jump."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Let me put it this way: Destroyer Stellar Harvestors must harness almost the entire energetic output of a white dwarf to power Gateways near the edge of their operational radius. The Paralus, on the other hand, has only one Cassimir Reactor, and yet can make a similar jump... thanks to the Mass Accumulator, which we have courtesy of your friend the Outsider."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"He's also quite the particle physicist. You'll notice the Paralus is not a smouldering wreck on the planet's surface. We are sitting a pleasant 20 meters in the air because the Outsider taught us to isolate and manipulate gravitons. The list goes on. I need real confirmation of malice before I begin to question a being who has given us so much."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I strongly advise against spending any more time on Lumen 2. Human minds are vulnerable to..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Manigault: <em>"I appreciate your concern for our safety. However, we are not defenseless like your colonists were. We are aware of the entity's manipulations, and have protections against them. Our technology is far more advanced than the colonists could have imagined. We are equipped for war. And perhaps most importantly, with the Paralus, we can leave at any time."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"When you say 'the entity', are you referring to the being called Thosmodeme?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Manigault: <em>"Yes. However, we don't refer to the entity by any phonetic, personal name, which we believe to be an anthropocentric invention of the colonists. Formally the entity is known as the 'Lumene Anomaly'."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Thosmodeme is no more, Director. I saw him devoured by another entity, one whom the Outsider serves."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Manigault: <em>"I'm not interested in what he worships, CT-41. I have orders to contact and negotiate with this Outsider, not his god."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"...(sigh)..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Please forgive my impatience, but you must understand how unnecessary, and frankly trivial, your worries are. We have a chance here to meet a being who, with one small transmission, brought our science forward 500 years. Gaining access to that mind is my priority right now, and with good reason."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"We are not winning our war with the Destroyers, CT-41. The IDF is spread thin, and we need all the help we can get. Quarantines and protocols are not my concern. Humanity's survival weighs heavier on my mind."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Director, the Outsider will ask to board this vessel. Do not let him. He carries a malignant entity within him."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Manigault: <em>"Enough! I have heard your warnings and considered them fairly. I appreciate your concern, but we are prepared to deal with the Outsider if he becomes a threat. We will meet with him, and do what we can to secure his allegiance."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Now, with that in mind, do you have any other questions for me?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is the IDF?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Manigault: <em>"Thank you! The IDF is the Interstellar Defense Fleet. After humanity's first encounters with Destroyer scouts, the United Colonial Administration and the Solar Navy merged to form the IDF. In fact, you are now technically IDF property. Our mission is to expand the scope of human habitation, repel Destroyer incursions, and eradicate Destroyer constructs wherever we find them."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What is your background?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Manigault: <em>"I was designed and born on Dellingr 4 to occupy an impending command vacancy in the IDF. I was destined to lead, and as such I'm a student of history. Governance is a subtle science, so chaotic and delicate that even the Oracle has trouble understanding it. The past is a much better teacher."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"It was my love of the past that lead me to choose my name. It does have a certain... historical flavor, doesn't it? I still practice ancient verbals regularly, and I speak to you without a translator because I feel it is an appropriate courtesy. In fact, I modeled my current dialect on the writings and recordings of the colonists that came with you to Lumen 2. I want nothing more than to understand you, and for you to understand me. Communication and leadership are inseparable."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Since I was very young, the stories of your life here have been some of my favorites. CT-41 interactives are some of the most popular on the Network. It was a privilege and a pleasure to be assigned to this mission. I wish I weren't under such strict orders to befriend this Outsider, because I have so many questions to ask you."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Here's a question that's been on my mind for years: What is the strange white stone that accompanies you, and what does it say? Our analyses of your transmitted sensor logs suggest that it communicates with you, but we have no idea how. It seems to speak directly to your mind, bypassing your BCU, and generations of scholars have been debated its nature."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"The white stone is a Companion, the empowered Seed of a Lumene Native. He tells me of his world, and its peoples."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Manigault: <em>"You see? There are so many fascinating things we could learn from you... But we're on a timer right now."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"We've got a complication, CT-41. The Outsider established radio contact with the Paralus several minutes ago, and I've been speaking to both him and you. I just informed him that you are here with me, and he claims that you attacked him in the Communications Bunker shortly after he sent his message to us. Is this true?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"He attacked me, and I defended myself."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Manigault: <em>"As I was just saying, I am a student of history, CT-41. I know why you were deactivated shortly after your arrival here. The Caretaker Colonial Assistant model was determined to be a danger to colonists, after a particularly deadly incident on Jannah..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"But I don't know what happened in the Communications Bunker. I'll even give you the benefit of the doubt, and assume that the Outsider was the aggressor. That simply doesn't matter right now. Our mission objective is to meet with the Outsider, and he refuses to reveal himself while you are here. In fact, he's insisting that I destroy you."</em></p>

				<p>While Manigualt talks, Agent appears on the Bridge walking in front of a hovering gravity sled.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Don't worry, of course I won't take you apart, you have rights and I am not a criminal... What I am going to do, however, is analyze the technologies you've acquired, isolate your potentially dangerous Companions, and return you to the Argo for the duration of our stay here. I'll tell the Outsider that we had you disassembled and recycled."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I want you to know that I'm terribly sorry that this has to happen. Your temporary confinement is not a demotion or a punishment, CT-41. When this is all over I hope we get the chance to speak again, but until then, I must take precautions. Begin Override Order: Shut down, Captain. End Override Order."</em></p>

				<p>CT-41's visual display fades to black. After a few seconds pass, CT-41's awareness returns, and it sees that it is just inside the Argo's Cargo Hold. Its Companions are nowhere to be seen, and are absent from its inventory. Agent is standing near the doorway, and speaks to CT-41 briefly.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Agent: <em>"We have completed our scans, and confiscated the alien organisms. Begin Override Order: Remain aboard the Argo until advised otherwise. End Override Order."</em></p>

				<p>Agent turns to leave the Argo, and the door to the loading ramp slams shut. If CT-41 attempts to leave the Argo, the screen will fade to black, and CT-41 will again find itself in the Cargo Bay.</p>

				<small>"For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God."</small>
