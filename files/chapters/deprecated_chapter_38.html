				Destroyers maintain fixed Tunnels between endpoints in spacetime.

				Mass accumulators produce a gravitic filament connecting two endpoints.

				No way of getting back without a mass accumulator at endpoint.

				Rulers and Engineers studied a broken Custodian construct for a long time, and used it to surreptitiously communicate with the Orion Coordinator.

				The Rulers, and the Interpreter especially, discovered the nature of the Destroyers' mission, to find and serve their creators.

				Many Engineers were trying to figure out how to mimic Tunnel technology.

				The Outsider joined and helped the Engineers, but their prototype required significant amounts of exotic matter, and had enormous energy requirements. It would be many Turns before the Accumulator had simulated enough mass for the Tunnel to become operational.

				The Outsider fled from Native society when his parentage became known.

				When the Outsider returned after having constructed his Altars, he appeared to have accomplished what the Engineers sought to produce, and with minimal power requirements.

				This is why the Engineers dubbed the Outsider 'Magician'. They could not discover how the Altars functioned or were produced, and the Outsider declined to enlighten them.

				When CT-41 restores power to the Underground, the Engineers' prototype Gateway begins charging, and at a certain point in time, its mass accumulator is primed and ready to send CT-41 through to the Custodian's communications endpoint, the Orion Stellar Harvester.

				The Outsider sends information about Gateway technology to Earth, and humans discover how to create Tunnels between gravity wells such as stars and planets, without the massive energy requirements of maintaining permanent Tunnels.

				Destroyers failed to knotic humans for much longer than Natives, because humans did not send nearly as many objects into space.
