				<p>When CT-41 has reached the Recycling Plant, it has the option to move up and to the west, into an area called the Mud Pits. This region above the Fossil Site contains caverns filled with runoff from the Mountainside, in which CT-41 can become quickly stuck. Enemies here will pester and damage CT-41 as it slogs its way through their territory.</p>

				<p>After CT-41 leaves the Mud Pits, it will enter a winding and eccentric stairway leading upward, and eventually arrive at a Native installation, called the Listening Post. The facility is a small bunker, larger than a typical Native habitation, but not by much. It is in a state of disrepair, and incredibly untidy. The rooms are dusty, the rest pool is dry and partially full of sediment, and no food containers are anywhere to be seen. There is no access to the surface from the Listening Post.</p>

				<p>In a room at the top of the Listening Post CT-41 finds a room dominated by several displays showing planets, stars, asteroids and comets. These images cycle fairly quickly. On the floor in the center of the room are the emaciated remains of a Native Engineer and its Pet. The Pet is similar to some of the creatures CT-41 encountered much earlier in the Menagerie. The Companion lets CT-41 know that the Native's Seed has not deteriorated.</p>
				
				<p class="character-dialog">Companion: <em>"Caretaker, this Kinsman's Seed is still viable. I believe I knew this Engineer once... but I would prefer that you speak to him. I would be honored if he joined us, Caretaker."</em></p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">He Who Hath Ears To Hear</div>

				<p>CT-41 moves toward the Engineer, and begins to speak to him.</p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Hello, Engineer."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Engineer: <em>"I was very tired, and very hungry, but now I am merely blind. What's happened to me?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Your body is dead."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Engineer: <em>"...I suppose that makes some sense, now that you mention it. Who are you, by the way?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I am CT-41, a Caretaker Automaton. I was brought here by my creators, who are not native to this world."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Engineer: <em>"The 41st of your kind, I presume. I'm pleased to make you acquaintance, Caretaker; you seem much more pleasant than the last aliens who dropped by. How are you speaking to me?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Your Seed is whole and has not deteriorated. One of your Kinsmen is acting as a translator for me, conveying my thoughts to you, and yours to me."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Engineer: <em>"Yes, I do recall that Healers were looking into that possibility... Wonderful science, just not my preferred field. Where are we right now?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"We are in a small, dirty room, full of planetary and stellar displays."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Engineer: <em>"That sounds just like my listening post! ...I'd love to catch up on the data, but I suppose that can wait. You've been very considerate to take time to speak to the dead. Welcome to my home, Caretaker. What can I tell you about myself?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"How did you come to live here?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Engineer: <em>"I came here, as near as I could to the surface, to construct my Listening Post, but that's not where the story begins."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Long ago, before the Destruction, certain Explorers came to the Engineers, and asked us how they might build small, swift crafts to cross the vast Emptiness. We helped them design their Probes, and then they built them, by the thousands."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"When the Rulers learned of the Explorers' intentions to launch their Probe fleet, they were alarmed. They supposed it would be danagerous to announce our existence to the cosmos, and they were right. The Rulers forbade the launch."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"But the Explorers were giddy with excitement, and launched the fleet before they could be stopped. After a quarter-Turn, some Probes began to reach their destinations, and soon floods of data returned to us. The Rulers withheld any judgment against the Explorers, pending the final outcome of their zeal."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"As the data came in, I found several worlds that might support the Kindred, perhaps even better than our own. Ambitious Explorers made plans to cross the Emptiness themselves, in crafts much larger than their Probes. They came to us again for help, and we would have given it, but the Destruction came first."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Let me know if I'm rambling, Caretaker. It's just been a long time since I last had a visitor, and it's so pleasant to have someone to talk to."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I'd like to keep listening to you, if that's all right."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Engineer: <em>"Splendid! As I was saying before I interrupted myself, the Destroyers found us, and burned our world. After they left, the Explorers were shamed, and banished to the Badlands. Yet in spite of all that had happened to the Kindred, tens of thousands of Probes continued unperturbed on their journeys. I decided that it was still our duty to listen, and hear what they had to say. I came as close to the surface as the Rulers would allow, and built this Listening Post myself, to capture whatever transmission fragments I could."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Many of my fellow Engineers mocked me. They considered me a fool. Some believed that I shamed our Lineage, because I did not join them in what they believed to be more urgent endeavors. Most regarded me with indifference, and not a single Engineer joined me in my labors. I lived a lonely life here, far from my Locus."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Did any non-Engineers help you?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Engineer: <em>"No one helped me decipher and analyze the data, but I was not alone in my work. I had my Pet, of course, but a disgraced Explorer was the best helper I could have asked for. He brought me food, so I could focus on my work, and brought me what news he could of the Remnant. He encouraged me in my efforts, and called me 'Stargazer'. I called him 'friend'."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"One feed-period my friend came to me with rations of Flow, as he always did, but brought a Little One with him also. I knew the Rulers had denied Continuation to the Explorers, but they were wrong to do so. I kept the Little One's birth a secret, as my friend knew I would."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"When he came to visit, the Little One eagerly listened to everything I could think of to tell him: the Truths of the Engineers, the Philosophers' legends of the Deep, the tales of distant worlds told by the Probes. His Seed was young and moldable, and his lights were still bright. I never had a Little One of my own; there never seemed to be enough time. Thus I gave the little Explorer everything I had, all the knowledge I could give."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"How did you die?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Stargazer: <em>"I don't actually remember dying, Caretaker, though I suppose it must have happened. My friend visited me regularly for several Turns, as his Little One grew. During his last visits the Little One no longer came, though by then he was hardly a child. My friend told me his offspring had become important among the Remnant. I had never felt such a swelling of pride..."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"But soon afterward my friend stopped coming to visit me. I was hurt, and still am, but I suppose the friendship must have run its course. I fed my Pet with what I food I had left, and listened to the Probes and their stories. You must remember, I had been here for so long that I did not know what else to do... At last I became weary. My senses grew weak, and I found it difficult to move. I tried to enter the Deep Sleep, but I didn't have the strength to do so. My lights began to dim."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I told my Pet to leave me, to return to the Badlands, or to find a new Kinsman better able to care for him. But in the last moment I can remember, before the lights went out, he was still there in front of me. He was always disobedient, and I think that's why I loved him."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"...I do not regret the decisions I made in life, Caretaker. As I listened to the Probes and the data they sent, I lived thousands of lives, on thousands of worlds. I listened to voices no one else heard, and did what I thought best, in the service of my Kindred. Perhaps as the world turns they will appreciate my efforts."</p></em>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What did you learn from the Probes?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Stargazer: <em>"I am happy to hear you ask so many questions! In fact, you remind me of the Little One who used to visit... As to your question, I've learned much, Caretaker. I've learned that many planets other than my own have been attacked by Destroyers. I've learned of small, white stars, enclosed in enormous shells, radiating strange energies. I've learned of timid beings that dwell in a great gaseous cloud where stars are born. I've learned of primitive life on several worlds, and the possibility of life on many more."</p></em>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Yet there is something tragic in the knowledge that I have gained. In the time it takes me to hurriedly process one transmission, a hundred more come in. The Probes have offered me far more than I can ever receive. It would take enormous storage arrays, and thousands of my brethren working with me, to fully analyze all the truths that have been sent to us."</p></em>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"But enough of my complaining! What else can I tell you?"</p></em>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"You mentioned timid beings that live in a nebula. What are they?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Stargazer: <em>"I do not know exactly, but I assume they are intelligent, and powerful... One Probe was dispatched to a nebula at nearly a light-Turn's distance. As it entered the nebula, an object emerged, and shadowed the Probe for several feed-periods. The object was not like any of the Destroyer constructs we categorized during the Destruction."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I monitored this Probe carefully, and focused all the antennae on it, to get the highest fidelity data possible from its transmission. The object finally approached the Probe, enveloped it, and its transmission ended shortly thereafter. I never saw what manner of being or beings had intercepted the Probe."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"I wish I could tell you more, but no other Probes were assigned to the nebula. Do you have any other questions for me, that I am perhaps better equipped to answer?"</p></em>
				
				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I do have another question, Stargazer, or rather a request. Like you, I am on a mission of exploration. The Companion who translates for me can empower your Seed, to see what I see, and to accompany me on my journey. If you are willing, we would be honored to have you join us. Will you?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Stargazer: <em>"I could not ask for any greater gift. Of course I will join you!"</p></em>

				<p>The Companion empowers the Stargazer's Seed, which glows blue as it rises from his remains. The Necrolith gains the power to leave mines and traps behind it, based on how much of the Singularity it has captured. These snares will damage or incapacitate enemies that pursue CT-41.</p>

				<p>As CT-41 moves to leave the room, the Stargazer makes a request of CT-41.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Stargazer: <em>"Caretaker, now that I see what's left of my Rascal, lying there on the floor, I feel a terrible sadness, and guilt. I hope that this in not too much to ask: Would he be able to join us too?"</p></em>

				<p>CT-41 does not respond, but Rascal's much smaller Seed rises from its remains, and orbits the blue Seed of the Stargazer for the remainder of Truth II. CT-41 leaves the Listening Post, and continues its explorations of the Underground.</p>
