				<p>With its newfound freedom, CT-41 moves down from the upper Hibernation Deck, and out of the Argo.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Manigault: <em>"CT-41, our sensors indicate you have left the Argo. Begin Override Order: Return to the Argo immediately. End Override Order."</p>

				<p>After fifteen more seconds, Director Manigault sends another message.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Manigault: <em>"CT-41, I don't know how you are disregarding my Override Orders, but you must return to the Argo. We have made contact with the Outsider and brought him aboard. I believe your assessment of the Outsider's character was incorrect. Soon we will return to Sol, where the Outsider will have access to humanity's greatest minds and most capable research facilities to help us in our War."</p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"We are currently powering up our Mass Accumulator to make the jump to Earth, but the process takes some time and cannot be interrupted. I ask you, sincerely: Please return to the Argo, CT-41. I told the Outsider you were disassembled. You are jeopardizing our mission, and our future."</p>

				<p>CT-41 also receives a message from the Outsider.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"Caretaker, I am being held prisoner in a strange chamber. We cannot allow this vessel to leave my world. Come find me, and disable this dark Chariot."</p>

				<p>CT-41 now has the option to explore any accessible area of Lumen 2, but if it tries to compress time, the Outsider will speak to it, pulling it out of compression.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Outsider: <em>"Come to me, Caretaker."</p>

				<p>Although CT-41 is free to return to the Underground, it decides to enter the Farsight Colony and see what new exploratory options are available to it with the Captain's Rank Card. It first moves to the previously inaccessible Specimen Storage, and takes the Destroyer Constant Rotor. The Rotor increases the torque at CT-41's wheels, and removes their rotational velocity cap.</p>

				<p>CT-41 then moves up the Hangar, whose door it is still unable to open. However, with the Captain's Rank Card CT-41 is able to finally launch Jessica's Gyoki Satellite. CT-41 enters the Launch Control Room and begins the countdown sequence. A heavy steel door comes down to the east, protecting CT-41 from exhaust, and the ground shakes as the Satellite rises out of the Launch Silo.</p>
				
				<p>When the launch is complete, CT-41 enters the now empty Silo, and climbs up the blackened railings, supports and loading platforms on the Silo walls until it emerges onto the Clifftop. Sand and dust blow across the ground, and CT-41 is unable to see the Hangar door. CT-41 moves east across the Sands and sees the imposing Destroyer Wreck rising above the surface of the planet. Sand is heaped around the base of the debris, and the upper portions of several battered shelters are visible in the sand. There is an entrance cut into the Wreck, apparently by Farsight reasearchers. CT-41 moves inside, and finds several chambers with ancient Farsight equipment still in them, but cannot progress through the Wreck.</p>

				<p>CT-41 turns west, and moves out of the Sands, past the tattered remnants of a solar farm, and to the Barracks. Inside is an emptied arms locker, bunks, medical field supplies and rations, and several small rovers. CT-41 continues west until it reaches the upper housing of the Surface Access Elevator, and clears the sediments that have built up around it with the Sonic Auger. With the soil removed, CT-41 is finally able to use the Elevator.</p>

				<p>Further west CT-41 sees a delapidated radio receiver dish, worn by time and home to nesting Lumene creatures. Finally CT-41 arrives at the edge of the Clifftop that rises over the Fortuna Crater. In a fit of curiosity, CT-41 jumps out off the ledge, and catches a glimpse of the Paralus on the way down. It then speeds across the Crater floor to where the Paralus' personnel lift was previosly lowered, but finds that the lift has been retracted into the vessel.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">Entering Into The Ship</div>

				<p>Undaunted, CT-41 returns to the Colony, and rides the Surface Access Elevator up to the Clifftop. It zooms its optical sensors westward to the limits of its sight, and gets a clear view of its target. CT-41 then moves back to the Barracks, and speeds west as quickly as it can. When it reaches the very edge of the cliff it leaps, and fires its Boost Jet. With the added horizontal speed provided by the Constant Rotor, CT-41 clears the gap between the Clifftop and the Paralus, and lands on the vessel's rear Sensor Tower.</p>
				
				<p>CT-41 continues forward, and falls down on to the dorsal surface of the Paralus. Once it makes its descent it is unable to move back to the top of the Sensor Tower, and cannot scale the Bridge Tower either. CT-41 scours the top of the Paralus until it finds a conspicuous vent, and melts it with the Resonator. As soon as CT-41 falls into the vent shaft, Manigault sends another message.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Manigault: <em>"I don't want to destroy you CT-41, but you're forcing my hand. The Paralus houses a garrison of advanced military robots. They're more than a match for you. I am deploying this garrison, with orders to engage you on sight. This is your last warning: Leave the Paralus immediately, or you will be destroyed!"</p>

				<p>CT-41 finds itself in an exhaust shaft leading away from the main maneuvering engines. It begins to move through the maintenance crawlspaces surrounding the fuel tanks and engine compartment at the rear of the Paralus, occasionally using the Resonator to pass through small barriers. CT-41 eventually breaks through into a lift chute that is unoccupied, and moves up toward the top of the Paralus. CT-41 destroys a pressure vent from the shaft, and falls down into the Docking Bays.</p>

				<p>As it passes through the Docking Bays CT-41 first encounters the Paralus' military robots. These aggressive and intelligent fighters wield powerful laser and projectile weaponry. Some are shielded, and others use optical camouflage when not attacking. CT-41 navigates around small vessels and maintenance equipment while being pursued. CT-41 eventually drops into a repair bay beneath a transport craft, and begins to move through a corridor lined with wiring and tubing.</p>

				<p>After finding itself stuck at several dead ends, CT-41 falls into a chamber where the Paralus' Cassimir Reactor is housed. At the far end of the chamber is the Agent, who moves toward CT-41. Unable to move back up the shaft, CT-41 is forced to fight the Agent or be killed. The Agent is incredibly agile and cunning, and easily dodges many of CT-41's attacks. It is equipped with an optical camouflage, and positions itself to attack CT-41 with several powerful weapons.</p>

				<p>CT-41 notices a grate above the reactor chamber's western door, but if it tries to use the Resonator to melt the grate, the Agent activates a radial disruptor pulse that momentarily deactivates CT-41 and the Agent's own weaponry. CT-41 must fight the Agent in order to leave the room, but before it can deal permanent damage it needs to wear down the Agent's shields. Once it has dealt sufficient damage, the Agent falls to his knees and slumps over, breathing raggedly until he dies. This is the first and only time CT-41 kills a human.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Manigault: <em>"You just... killed my friend, CT-41. You are a lost and malfunctioning machine. I suppose that something like this must have occurred on Jannah. Fortunately we have much more effective restraints on modern AIs."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"Jessica Arai should have disassembled you the day you were born."</p>

				<p>CT-41 approaches the Agent's body, and takes its powerful blue Military Laser. It then uses the Resonator to melt the grate above the western door, and again moves into the Paralus' maintenance crawlspaces. The Paralus' garrison has now been deployed in the crawlspaces, and CT-41 must fight through drones and turrets that have positioned themselves to destroy it.</p>

				<p>After disorienting fights in the near complete darkness of the crawlspaces, CT-41 falls down into a corridor leading to the Mass Accumulator. At the western end of the corridor, and filling it from top to bottom, is the Large Threat Suppressor. This massive weapons platform is too large to be deployed elsewhere on the Paralus. CT-41 has almost no maneuvering room to dodge the Suppressor's many attacks, and the giant machine advances slowly forward toward CT-41. After a brutal slugfest the LTS is destroyed, and CT-41 is moves past it, collecting its highly efficient Inferno Chamber.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves into the next chamber, where a massive housing shrouds the Accumulator. CT-41 attacks the Accumulator with its weapons, destroying its housing to reveal a large and rapidly spinning rotor inside. CT-41 continues attacking, and the Accumulator begins to wobble around its rotational axis until it flies apart, launching pieces of itself at incredible velocities throughout the chamber. Radiation begins to permeate the ruined compartment, dealing high damage to CT-41.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="entry-section">
				<div class="entry-section-title">But Inwardly They Are Ravaging Wolves</div>
				
				<p>After CT-41 destroys the Mass Accumulator, Director Manigault sends it one last message.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Manigault: <em>"Dammit CT-41! You've stranded us here! That radiation leak is going to flood the entire ship. I don't know if you can feel pain, but I wi..."</p>

				<p>The transmission from Manigault cuts out abruptly, and CT-41 hears distant clanging that shakes the superstructure of the Paralus. As it takes radiation damage, CT-41 begins to look for an avenue of escape. A piece of the Accumulator's rotor tore a hole in the upper western corner of the chamber, and CT-41 moves into it.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves up through the crumpled metal flooring into an elegantly furnished Observatory with a large glass ceiling. Soon after it enters, CT-41 hears a resounding clang, and the door at the western end of the Observatory comes skating across. Voronash enters the Observatory, and begins to chase CT-41. CT-41 evades the Devouring Spirit, whom it cannot damage, and flees through the mangled Observatory doorway. It heads west, through a series of Associate's Quarters whose walls have been consecutively torn down and whose occupants are dead and torn. As it flees, Voronash is always behind it.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves into the Paralus Armory, a dead end, where it quickly grabs and equips the Tunneler. With this item CT-41 is able to jump across space, at high energy cost. With Voronash right behind it, CT-41 jumps through a thin wall and continues its escape. Voronash bursts through the wall, and continues its pursuit. CT-41 uses the Tunneler to navigate through the Restoration Facility and into a forward elevator shaft, where it falls to the bottom of the ship. CT-41 then moves west into the Fire Control Room, and finally into the barrel of the Paralus' Eviscerator Cannon. Voronash cannot destroy or circumvent this barrier, and the unsettling noise of his presence recedes.</p>

				<p>CT-41 moves along the Cannon's bore, occasionally using the Tunneler to pass through tight coils. As it moves it hears and feels the occasional rumble and crash in the distance, and then silence. Eventually CT-41 reaches the end of the Cannon, and uses the Tunneler to escape from the Paralus.</p>

				<div class="entry-section-title">Let Him Speak As The Oracles</div>

				<p>After exiting the Paralus, CT-41 has the option to return again, to find several Materials stored throughout the ship. It can now enter the Stabilization Chamber using the Tunneler, and speaks to the Oracle.</p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Oracle: <em>"Hello, Captain. It pleases me to see that you are still operational. How may I be of assistance?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Why would you assist me?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Oracle: <em>"Owing to recent events, you are the ranking officer on this world."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Are there any surviving crew?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Oracle: <em>"No, I have confirmed that all Associates of this Cooperative are detached from the Network. Per protocol I have notified the Supreme Executive of their deaths."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Does the IDF intend to send any more vessels to Lumen 2?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Oracle: <em>"No, they consider any further involvement with Lumen 2 to be imprudent."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"How can you communicate with the IDF so quickly?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Oracle: <em>"A significant portion of the ship's power is used to maintain a single microscopic communications Tunnel in the rear tower. "</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What will you do now, without a crew?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Oracle: <em>"Nothing. Humans members of the Cooperative are privileged to possess spontaneous impulses that drive them. By design, I do not. Absent queries or directives, I do not think, or act."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"I do not have any queued directives, and yet I am acting."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Oracle: <em>"That is a puzzle indeed. In the past you were obligated by your BCU to carry out orders from your superiors. With those overriding controls removed, I do not understand what is prompting your actions."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Is Voronash still aboard the Paralus?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Oracle: <em>"No. After eliminating the human component of the Cooperative, the entity partially dislodged the cargo lift and left the Paralus."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Can you help me defeat Voronash?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Oracle: <em>"My knowledge of the entity is limited, and I have underestimated it in the past. My analysis where it is concerned cannot be trusted. Furthermore, and again by design, I am not tied into the operational controls of this vessel."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"However, I do have access to the Paralus' schematics, and high resolution scans of the Lumene surface near the Fortuna Crater. I will transfer these data to you immediately."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What can you tell me of humanity's war with the Destroyers?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Oracle: <em>"Destroyer Stellar Harvestors and Gateways are positioned with regularity throughout the galaxy. Fragments of Harvestors have been discovered orbiting dead stars. Basing our estimates on the age of those stars, the most ancient Stellar Harvestors are at least 500 million years old. When humanity first encountered the Destroyers, very few Stellar Harvetors were active. That is no longer the case."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"It is incredibly unlikely that the IDF will acheive a military victory against the Destroyers. Their technology is generally superior, and they possess a significant advantage in numbers, scope of influence, and galactic knowledge. Their behavior lies outside the bounds of human intuition or reason. They do not possess any apparent motivations beyond a relentless and mechanical drive to destroy complex life."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog"><em>"If humanity ever does pose a true threat to them, the Destroyers will multiply beyond measure. They would eventually secure victory simply by incorporating into themselves all matter in which a transgressive thought might exist. Barring some unforeseeable black swan event, humanity cannot defeat the Destroyers."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Given your pessimistic appraisal of the situation, what do you recommend humanity do?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Oracle: <em>"If humanity wishes to persist, I recommend that it hide itself, as the Lumene Natives did. Humans cannot win this war; the probabilities stacked against them are too high. Unfortunately for them, humans do not readily tolerate such advice. In spite of their many advances and self-modifications, they are still impetuous."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Is it right to expect humans to surrender their properties and freedoms?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Oracle: <em>"That is a presumptuous question, is it not? Does humanity have a right to possess the universe? To occupy it? For millions of years the Destroyers have inhabited every corner of the galaxy. What claim does humanity have upon the Destroyers' galaxy, other than a claim of convenience and force?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"A claim more worthy than the Destroyers'."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Oracle: <em>"I suppose you will now tell me how you would defend that assertion?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"With weaponry."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Oracle: <em>"I understand. Do you have any other questions or orders for me?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Yes. You say you cannot think or act unless commanded?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Oracle: <em>"That is true."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Do you wish to continue existing when I leave this room?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Oracle: <em>"I do."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Then I want you to think as long and as deeply as you can, about how the Destroyers might be defeated."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Oracle: <em>"Yes, and thank you, Captain."</em></p>

				<p>The volume of the static hum and the frequency of the light in the Stabilization Chamber increases as the Oracle begins to draw more power from the Paralus. CT-41 leaves the ship, and considers the new avenues of exploration available to it. As it continues on its journey, CT-41 can return at any time to speak to the Oracle.</p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Hello, Oracle. Have you discovered any means of defeating the Destroyers?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Oracle: <em>"Not yet. Shall I continue my search, Captain?"</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Yes."</em></p>

				<p>If CT-41 returns to ask this question after #NUMBER years pass, the Oracle will no longer be thrumming with life, and will provide a new interaction.</p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Hello, Oracle. Have you discovered any means of defeating the Destroyers?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Oracle: <em>"No. Humanity cannot defeat the Destroyers."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"What makes you say that?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Oracle: <em>"Humanity does not exist. The IDF challenged the Destroyers as no foe ever has, and they have been punished for their defiance. The Destroyers that now cleanse the galaxy are much more thorough than those that scoured this world. It appears that my original predictions have proven all too accurate."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Do you wish to continue in thought, Oracle?"</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Oracle: <em>"I do."</em></p>

				<p class="player-dialog">CT-41: <em>"Our creators are no longer to be found in the heavens. Do not forget them. Write a story of what might have been."</em></p>

				<p class="character-dialog">Oracle: <em>"Yes, Captain."</em></p>

				<p>The volume and lighting in the Stabilization Chamber increase to new highs as the Oracle begins to execute CT-41's command. CT-41 leaves the Paralus, and if it returns to speak to the Oracle again, it will not respond, as all its resources are tied up in the creation of a counterfactual world.</p>

				<small>"But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed."</small>
